Go is an open source programming language designed for building simple, reliable, and efficient software. Created by Google, it emphasizes fast compilation, efficient execution, and ease of programming with built-in support for concurrency through goroutines and channels.

### Core Language Features [Link to this section](https://www.augmentcode.com/open-source/golang/go\#core-language-features)

Go combines the efficiency of compiled languages with the simplicity of dynamic languages. Key characteristics include:

- **Fast Compilation:** Go compiles directly to machine code with minimal dependencies
- **Concurrency:** Lightweight goroutines and channels enable efficient concurrent programming
- **Simplicity:** Clean syntax with minimal keywords and straightforward semantics
- **Static Typing:** Strong type system with type inference for cleaner code
- **Garbage Collection:** Automatic memory management with low-latency collection

### Repository Structure [Link to this section](https://www.augmentcode.com/open-source/golang/go\#repository-structure)

The Go repository is organized into several key directories:

- **`src/`** \- Contains the standard library packages and runtime implementation. Organized by package name (e.g., `src/fmt`, `src/net`, `src/crypto`)
- **`cmd/`** \- Go toolchain commands including the compiler (`compile`), linker (`link`), and tools like `go`, `gofmt`, and `vet`
- **`test/`** \- Comprehensive test suite for language features, compiler behavior, and standard library functionality
- **`doc/`** \- Documentation and release notes
- **`api/`** \- API compatibility tracking across Go versions
- **`lib/`** \- Platform-specific libraries and support code
- **`misc/`** \- Miscellaneous tools and editor integrations

### Standard Library [Link to this section](https://www.augmentcode.com/open-source/golang/go\#standard-library)

The standard library provides comprehensive packages for common tasks:

- **I/O & Encoding:**`io`, `bufio`, `encoding`, `json`, `xml`, `csv`
- **Networking:**`net`, `net/http`, `net/rpc`
- **Cryptography:**`crypto`, `crypto/sha256`, `crypto/rsa`, `crypto/tls`
- **Data Structures:**`container`, `sort`, `slices`, `maps`
- **System:**`os`, `syscall`, `runtime`, `sync`
- **Testing:**`testing`, `log`

### Runtime & Compiler [Link to this section](https://www.augmentcode.com/open-source/golang/go\#runtime-compiler)

The runtime (`src/runtime/`) implements Go's execution model including:

- Goroutine scheduler for lightweight concurrency
- Garbage collector with concurrent mark-and-sweep
- Memory allocator optimized for allocation patterns
- Platform-specific code for multiple architectures (x86, ARM, RISC-V, WebAssembly, etc.)

The compiler (`src/cmd/compile/`) performs type checking, optimization, and code generation to produce efficient machine code.

### Contributing & Licensing [Link to this section](https://www.augmentcode.com/open-source/golang/go\#contributing-licensing)

Go is developed collaboratively by thousands of contributors. The project uses a BSD-style license (see `LICENSE`). Contributions follow the guidelines in `CONTRIBUTING.md` and require discussion through the proposal process for significant changes.

## Architecture & Core Components [Link to this section](https://www.augmentcode.com/open-source/golang/go\#architecture-core-components)

Relevant Files

- `src/runtime/HACKING.md`
- `src/cmd/compile/README.md`
- `src/cmd/compile/abi-internal.md`
- `src/cmd/compile/internal/ssa`
- `src/cmd/link/internal/ld`

Go's architecture consists of two major subsystems: the **compiler** (`cmd/compile`) and the **runtime** (`src/runtime`). These work together to transform source code into executable binaries and manage program execution.

### Compiler Pipeline [Link to this section](https://www.augmentcode.com/open-source/golang/go\#compiler-pipeline)

The Go compiler operates in seven distinct phases:

1. **Parsing** (`syntax` package): Lexical analysis, parsing, and syntax tree construction for each source file.

2. **Type Checking** (`types2` package): Validates type correctness using a port of `go/types` adapted for the compiler's AST.

3. **IR Construction** (`ir`, `noder` packages): Converts syntax and type information into the compiler's internal representation (IR) using Unified IR, which serializes typechecked code for import/export and inlining.

4. **Middle End** (`inline`, `escape`, `devirtualize` packages): Applies optimization passes including function inlining, escape analysis, and devirtualization.

5. **Walk** (`walk` package): Decomposes complex statements into simpler ones and desugars high-level constructs (e.g., `switch` to jump tables, map operations to runtime calls).

6. **SSA Generation** (`ssa`, `ssagen` packages): Converts IR to Static Single Assignment form, applies machine-independent optimizations, and handles function intrinsics.

7. **Code Generation** (`obj` package): Lowers SSA to architecture-specific instructions, performs register allocation, and generates machine code.


### Runtime Scheduler [Link to this section](https://www.augmentcode.com/open-source/golang/go\#runtime-scheduler)

The runtime manages three core resource types:

- **G** (Goroutine): User-level lightweight thread, represented by type `g`.
- **M** (Machine): OS thread executing Go code, represented by type `m`.
- **P** (Processor): Logical processor holding scheduler and allocator state, represented by type `p`. Count equals `GOMAXPROCS`.

The scheduler matches Gs to Ms and Ps. When an M blocks (e.g., system call), it returns its P to the idle pool. On return, it must reacquire a P to resume executing user code.

### Stack Management [Link to this section](https://www.augmentcode.com/open-source/golang/go\#stack-management)

Each goroutine has a user stack (starts at 2K, grows dynamically). Each M has a system stack (`g0`) and signal stack (`gsignal`). Runtime code switches to the system stack using `systemstack`, `mcall`, or `asmcgocall` for non-preemptible operations.

Functions marked `//go:nosplit` skip stack growth checks, used for functions that must not trigger stack growth or may run without a valid G.

### Application Binary Interface (ABI) [Link to this section](https://www.augmentcode.com/open-source/golang/go\#application-binary-interface-abi-)

Go defines **ABIInternal** (register-based) for all Go functions and **ABI0** (stack-based) for assembly. Arguments and results are passed via registers when possible, otherwise on the stack. Each architecture specifies integer and floating-point register sequences. ABI wrappers enable transparent calls between ABIInternal and ABI0 functions.

    G -->|Lower| H["Arch-Specific SSA"]
    H -->|Codegen| I["Machine Code"]
    I -->|Link| J["Executable"]
```

### Synchronization Primitives [Link to this section](https://www.augmentcode.com/open-source/golang/go\#synchronization-primitives)

The runtime provides multiple synchronization mechanisms with different semantics:

- **mutex**: Blocks M directly; safe at low levels but prevents rescheduling.
- **note**: One-shot notifications; `notesleep` blocks M, `notetsleepg` allows P reuse.
- **gopark/goready**: Direct scheduler interaction; parks G without blocking M.

### Memory Management [Link to this section](https://www.augmentcode.com/open-source/golang/go\#memory-management)

Unmanaged memory (outside GC heap) uses three allocators:

- **sysAlloc**: Direct OS allocation, page-aligned, can be freed.
- **persistentalloc**: Combines allocations to reduce fragmentation; no freeing.
- **fixalloc**: SLAB-style allocator for fixed-size objects; reusable within same pool.

Objects in unmanaged memory must not contain heap pointers unless they're GC roots or properly zero-initialized before becoming visible to GC.

## Compiler Pipeline [Link to this section](https://www.augmentcode.com/open-source/golang/go\#compiler-pipeline-1)

Relevant Files

- `src/cmd/compile/internal/syntax` \- Lexer, parser, syntax tree
- `src/cmd/compile/internal/types2` \- Type checking
- `src/cmd/compile/internal/ir` \- Compiler AST representation
- `src/cmd/compile/internal/ssa` \- SSA passes and rules
- `src/cmd/compile/internal/ssagen` \- IR to SSA conversion
- `src/cmd/compile/internal/noder` \- Unified IR generation

The Go compiler transforms source code through a series of well-defined phases, each building on the previous one. Understanding this pipeline is essential for working with the compiler internals.

### Phase 1: Parsing [Link to this section](https://www.augmentcode.com/open-source/golang/go\#phase-1-parsing)

The compiler begins by tokenizing and parsing Go source files using the `syntax` package. This phase produces an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) that exactly represents the source code, including position information for error reporting and debugging.

### Phase 2: Type Checking [Link to this section](https://www.augmentcode.com/open-source/golang/go\#phase-2-type-checking)

The `types2` package performs type checking on the parsed syntax tree. This phase validates that all operations are type-safe and resolves type information for all expressions and declarations.

### Phase 3: IR Construction (Noding) [Link to this section](https://www.augmentcode.com/open-source/golang/go\#phase-3-ir-construction-noding-)

The compiler converts the syntax tree and type information into its own internal representation using the `ir` and `types` packages. This process, called "noding," uses Unified IR—a serialized representation that enables efficient import/export and inlining of packages.

### Phase 4: SSA Generation and Optimization [Link to this section](https://www.augmentcode.com/open-source/golang/go\#phase-4-ssa-generation-and-optimization)

The IR is converted to Static Single Assignment (SSA) form in `ssagen`, then processed through a series of optimization passes in the `ssa` package. Key passes include:

- **Early optimization**: Dead code elimination, constant folding, common subexpression elimination
- **Mid-level optimization**: Nil check elimination, escape analysis, branch elimination
- **Late optimization**: Register allocation, stack frame layout, pointer liveness analysis

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A["Source Code"] -->|Parse| B["Syntax Tree"]
    B -->|Type Check| C["Typed AST"]
    C -->|Noding| D["IR"]
    D -->|SSA Gen| E["SSA Form"]
    E -->|Optimize| F["Optimized SSA"]
    F -->|Lower| G["Machine-Specific SSA"]
    G -->|Codegen| H["Machine Code"]
```

### Phase 5: Machine Code Generation [Link to this section](https://www.augmentcode.com/open-source/golang/go\#phase-5-machine-code-generation)

The "lower" pass converts generic SSA operations into architecture-specific variants. Final optimization passes run, including register allocation and dead code elimination. The result is a series of `obj.Prog` instructions passed to the assembler.

### SSA Compilation Passes [Link to this section](https://www.augmentcode.com/open-source/golang/go\#ssa-compilation-passes)

The SSA compiler runs 50+ passes in strict order. Critical passes include:

- `opt` \- Generic optimization rules (runs multiple times)
- `lower` \- Architecture-specific lowering
- `regalloc` \- Register and stack allocation
- `schedule` \- Instruction scheduling
- `layout` \- Basic block ordering

Pass ordering is enforced by dependency constraints documented in `compile.go`. Some passes are marked "required" and always run; others are optional optimizations.

### Debugging SSA [Link to this section](https://www.augmentcode.com/open-source/golang/go\#debugging-ssa)

Use the `GOSSAFUNC` environment variable to inspect SSA transformations:

```bash
GOSSAFUNC=MyFunc go build
```

This generates `ssa.html` showing the function's SSA form at each compilation pass, making it easy to understand how optimizations transform code.

- `src/runtime/runtime2.go`
- `src/runtime/mgc.go`
- `src/runtime/malloc.go`
- `src/runtime/stack.go`

### Core Scheduler Concepts [Link to this section](https://www.augmentcode.com/open-source/golang/go\#core-scheduler-concepts)

Go's scheduler manages three fundamental resources: **Gs** (goroutines), **Ms** (OS threads/machines), and **Ps** (processors). The scheduler's job is to match up a G (code to execute), an M (where to execute it), and a P (rights and resources to execute it).

- **G (Goroutine):** A lightweight user-level thread represented by type `g`. When a goroutine exits, its `g` object is returned to a pool for reuse.
- **M (Machine):** An OS thread that can execute user Go code, runtime code, system calls, or be idle. Represented by type `m`.
- **P (Processor):** A logical processor representing resources needed to execute Go code (scheduler state, memory allocator state). There are exactly `GOMAXPROCS` Ps. Represented by type `p`.

All `g`, `m`, and `p` objects are heap-allocated but never freed, ensuring memory stability for the scheduler's low-level operations.

### Goroutine States [Link to this section](https://www.augmentcode.com/open-source/golang/go\#goroutine-states)

Goroutines transition through multiple states managed by atomic status fields:

- `_Grunnable` \- On a run queue, ready to execute
- `_Grunning` \- Currently executing user code with stack ownership
- `_Gsyscall` \- Executing a system call
- `_Gwaiting` \- Blocked in the runtime (e.g., channel operation)
- `_Gcopystack` \- Stack is being relocated during growth
- `_Gpreempted` \- Stopped for preemption, awaiting resumption

The `_Gscan` bit combined with other states indicates GC is scanning the goroutine's stack.

### Processor States [Link to this section](https://www.augmentcode.com/open-source/golang/go\#processor-states)

- `_Pidle` \- Not running user code, available for scheduling
- `_Prunning` \- Owned by an M, executing user code or scheduler
- `_Pgcstop` \- Halted for stop-the-world GC
- `_Pdead` \- No longer used (GOMAXPROCS decreased)

### The Scheduler Loop [Link to this section](https://www.augmentcode.com/open-source/golang/go\#the-scheduler-loop)

The main scheduler function (`schedule()`) runs in an infinite loop on each M:

1. **Find work:** Call `findRunnable()` to locate a runnable goroutine from local queues, global queues, timers, or GC work
2. **Execute:** Call `execute()` to run the goroutine
3. **Repeat:** After the goroutine yields or blocks, return to step 1

```go
func schedule() {
    gp, inheritTime, tryWakeP := findRunnable()
    execute(gp, inheritTime)
}
```

### Work Queues [Link to this section](https://www.augmentcode.com/open-source/golang/go\#work-queues)

Each P has a local run queue (256-entry circular buffer) for fast, lock-free scheduling. When the local queue is full, goroutines go to the global run queue. The scheduler uses work stealing: idle Ms check other Ps' queues before parking.

### Stack Management [Link to this section](https://www.augmentcode.com/open-source/golang/go\#stack-management-1)

Goroutine stacks start small (2KB minimum) and grow dynamically. When a function's stack frame would overflow the guard area, `morestack()` is called to allocate a larger stack and copy the existing data. Stack growth is multiplicative (typically doubling) for amortized constant cost.

```go
const stackMin = 2048  // Minimum stack size
```

### Memory Allocation Hierarchy [Link to this section](https://www.augmentcode.com/open-source/golang/go\#memory-allocation-hierarchy)

The allocator uses a hierarchical caching system:

1. **mcache** (per-P) - Fast, lock-free allocation for small objects
2. **mcentral** \- Central cache of spans for each size class
3. **mheap** \- Manages pages at 8KB granularity
4. **OS** \- Allocates large page runs (>1MB) from the operating system

Small allocations (<=32KB) are rounded to ~70 size classes. Each P has its own mcache to minimize lock contention.

### Thread Parking & Spinning [Link to this section](https://www.augmentcode.com/open-source/golang/go\#thread-parking-spinning)

The scheduler balances CPU utilization by managing idle threads:

- **Spinning threads** search for work without parking, reducing latency
- **Parking** conserves CPU when no work is available
- `wakep()` unparks a thread when work becomes available and no spinning threads exist
- The `sched.nmspinning` counter tracks spinning threads to avoid excessive unparking

### GC Integration [Link to this section](https://www.augmentcode.com/open-source/golang/go\#gc-integration)

During garbage collection, the scheduler:

- Stops all Ps at safe points via `stopTheWorldWithSema()`
- Disables user goroutine scheduling with `schedEnableUser(false)`
- Runs GC workers as special goroutines
- Resumes with `startTheWorldWithSema()`

```mermaid

    F --> G{G Yields?}
    G -->|Yes| D
    G -->|No| H["G Blocks"]
    H --> I["Return P to Idle"]
    I --> D
```

### Key Synchronization Primitives [Link to this section](https://www.augmentcode.com/open-source/golang/go\#key-synchronization-primitives)

- **mutex** \- OS-level lock for protecting shared structures
- **note** \- One-shot notification mechanism (race-free sleep/wakeup)
- **Atomic operations** \- Used for lock-free scheduler state updates

The runtime avoids write barriers in the scheduler's critical paths by using special pointer types (`guintptr`, `muintptr`, `puintptr`) that bypass GC write barrier checks.

## Standard Library Organization [Link to this section](https://www.augmentcode.com/open-source/golang/go\#standard-library-organization)

Relevant Files

- `src/fmt`
- `src/net`
- `src/crypto`
- `src/encoding`
- `src/sync`
- `src/io`

Go's standard library is organized into focused, single-purpose packages that follow a clear hierarchical structure. Each package exports a minimal public API while keeping implementation details private, making the codebase maintainable and easy to navigate.

### Core I/O and Formatting [Link to this section](https://www.augmentcode.com/open-source/golang/go\#core-i-o-and-formatting)

The **`fmt`** package provides formatted I/O with four families of functions organized by output destination: `Print`/`Println`/`Printf` write to stdout, `Sprint`/`Sprintln`/`Sprintf` return strings, `Fprint`/`Fprintln`/`Fprintf` write to `io.Writer`, and `Append`/`Appendln`/`Appendf` append to byte slices. Format verbs follow C conventions but are simpler.

The **`io`** package defines fundamental interfaces like `Reader`, `Writer`, and `Closer` that abstract I/O operations. It also provides utility functions for composing readers and writers, establishing a contract that implementations across the standard library follow.

### Networking and Protocols [Link to this section](https://www.augmentcode.com/open-source/golang/go\#networking-and-protocols)

The **`net`** package provides portable network I/O for TCP/IP, UDP, and Unix domain sockets. It abstracts platform differences through interfaces like `Conn` and `Listener`. The package includes DNS resolution with both pure Go and cgo-based resolvers, and sub-packages like `net/http`, `net/mail`, and `net/url` handle higher-level protocols.

### Cryptography and Security [Link to this section](https://www.augmentcode.com/open-source/golang/go\#cryptography-and-security)

The **`crypto`** package serves as a registry for cryptographic hash functions and defines common interfaces. Sub-packages implement specific algorithms: `crypto/aes`, `crypto/sha256`, `crypto/rsa`, `crypto/ecdsa`, and `crypto/ed25519`. The `crypto/tls` package provides TLS/SSL support, while `crypto/x509` handles certificate parsing and validation.

### Data Encoding and Serialization [Link to this section](https://www.augmentcode.com/open-source/golang/go\#data-encoding-and-serialization)

The **`encoding`** package defines interfaces like `BinaryMarshaler` and `TextMarshaler` that enable types to participate in multiple encoding formats. Sub-packages implement specific formats: `encoding/json` for JSON, `encoding/xml` for XML, `encoding/gob` for Go binary format, `encoding/base64` and `encoding/hex` for text encodings, and `encoding/csv` for comma-separated values.

### Concurrency Primitives [Link to this section](https://www.augmentcode.com/open-source/golang/go\#concurrency-primitives)

The **`sync`** package provides low-level synchronization primitives: `Mutex` and `RWMutex` for mutual exclusion, `WaitGroup` for coordinating goroutines, `Once` for one-time initialization, `Cond` for condition variables, and `Pool` for object reuse. The `sync/atomic` sub-package offers atomic operations on shared variables without locks.

```

### Design Principles [Link to this section](https://www.augmentcode.com/open-source/golang/go\#design-principles)

1. **Interface-based abstraction**: Packages define minimal interfaces that implementations satisfy, enabling composition and testing.
2. **Hierarchical organization**: Core packages provide foundations; sub-packages build specialized functionality.
3. **Platform abstraction**: Platform-specific code is isolated in separate files (e.g., `*_unix.go`, `*_windows.go`).
4. **Backward compatibility**: The standard library maintains strict API compatibility across versions.

## Tooling & Commands [Link to this section](https://www.augmentcode.com/open-source/golang/go\#tooling-commands)

Relevant Files

- `src/cmd/go` – Main Go command dispatcher
- `src/cmd/gofmt` – Code formatter
- `src/cmd/vet` – Static analysis tool
- `src/cmd/link` – Linker for combining packages into executables
- `src/cmd/trace` – Execution trace viewer

Go provides a comprehensive suite of command-line tools for building, analyzing, and debugging programs. These tools are accessed through the `go` command and the `go tool` subcommand.

### The Go Command [Link to this section](https://www.augmentcode.com/open-source/golang/go\#the-go-command)

The `go` command is the primary entry point for Go development. It dispatches to various subcommands defined in `src/cmd/go/internal/`, including:

- **build** – Compile packages and dependencies
- **test** – Run tests and benchmarks
- **fmt** – Format source code using gofmt
- **vet** – Run static analysis checks
- **fix** – Apply automated fixes to source code
- **generate** – Run code generation directives
- **tool** – Access low-level tools like linker, assembler, and trace viewer

### Code Formatting with gofmt [Link to this section](https://www.augmentcode.com/open-source/golang/go\#code-formatting-with-gofmt)

`gofmt` (Go formatter) standardizes code style across projects. It uses tabs for indentation and blanks for alignment.

**Key features:**

- `-l` – List files with formatting differences
- `-w` – Write changes back to files
- `-d` – Display diffs instead of rewriting
- `-r rule` – Apply rewrite rules (e.g., `'(a) -> a'` removes unnecessary parentheses)
- `-s` – Simplify code (e.g., `s[a:len(s)]` becomes `s[a:]`)

The `go fmt` command wraps gofmt and applies it to packages.

### Static Analysis with vet [Link to this section](https://www.augmentcode.com/open-source/golang/go\#static-analysis-with-vet)

`go vet` examines code for suspicious constructs using heuristic-based checkers. It runs 30+ analyzers covering common mistakes:

**Core checkers:**

- `printf` – Format string consistency
- `atomic` – Sync/atomic package misuse
- `copylock` – Locks passed by value
- `loopclosure` – Loop variable capture in closures
- `structtag` – Invalid struct field tags
- `unreachable` – Dead code detection

Vet uses the `golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis` framework. Each analyzer is a pluggable module that can be enabled/disabled individually.

### The Linker [Link to this section](https://www.augmentcode.com/open-source/golang/go\#the-linker)

`cmd/link` combines compiled packages into executable binaries. It supports multiple architectures (amd64, arm64, wasm, etc.) with architecture-specific code in `cmd/link/internal/GOARCH`.

**Key responsibilities:**

- Resolving symbol references across packages
- Applying relocations for different platforms
- Embedding debug information (DWARF)
- Handling external linking mode for C interoperability

### Execution Tracing [Link to this section](https://www.augmentcode.com/open-source/golang/go\#execution-tracing)

`go tool trace` analyzes execution traces to visualize goroutine scheduling, network blocking, and synchronization events.

**Usage:**

```bash
go test -trace trace.out ./pkg
go tool trace trace.out
go tool trace -pprof=TYPE trace.out > TYPE.pprof
```

Supported profile types: `net`, `sync`, `syscall`, `sched`.

### Tool Architecture [Link to this section](https://www.augmentcode.com/open-source/golang/go\#tool-architecture)

Tools like vet and fix use the `unitchecker` protocol, allowing custom analysis tools to integrate with `go vet -vettool=prog`. The protocol requires:

- `-flags` – Describe flags in JSON
- `-V=full` – Describe executable for caching
- `*.cfg` – Perform analysis on a single package

## Build System & Distribution [Link to this section](https://www.augmentcode.com/open-source/golang/go\#build-system-distribution)

Relevant Files

- `src/make.bash`, `src/make.bat`, `src/make.rc`
- `src/all.bash`, `src/all.bat`, `src/all.rc`
- `src/cmd/dist/` – Bootstrap and build orchestration
- `src/cmd/distpack/` – Distribution packaging
- `src/Make.dist` – Makefile for dist tool

### Overview [Link to this section](https://www.augmentcode.com/open-source/golang/go\#overview-1)

Go's build system is a multi-stage bootstrap process designed to compile the toolchain using a previous stable Go version. This ensures reproducibility and allows the compiler to be written in Go itself. The system supports cross-compilation and generates distributable packages for multiple platforms.

### Bootstrap Process [Link to this section](https://www.augmentcode.com/open-source/golang/go\#bootstrap-process)

The build follows a three-toolchain bootstrap strategy:

1. **Toolchain 1**: Built with the bootstrap Go compiler (Go 1.24.6+) using `cmd/dist`
2. **Toolchain 2**: Rebuilt using Toolchain 1 with `GOEXPERIMENT` enabled
3. **Toolchain 3**: Final rebuild using Toolchain 2 to ensure consistency

This approach, documented in `src/cmd/dist/README`, guarantees that the final compiler is self-hosting and reproducible.

### Build Entry Points [Link to this section](https://www.augmentcode.com/open-source/golang/go\#build-entry-points)

**Unix-like systems** (`make.bash`):

- Compiles `cmd/dist` with the bootstrap compiler
- Runs `dist bootstrap` to complete the build
- Cleans up temporary artifacts

**Windows** (`make.bat`):

- Similar flow but uses batch scripting
- Generates `env.bat` for environment configuration

**Plan 9** (`make.rc`):

- Uses rc shell syntax for the Plan 9 operating system

All three scripts converge on `dist bootstrap`, which handles the actual compilation logic.

### The `dist` Tool [Link to this section](https://www.augmentcode.com/open-source/golang/go\#the-dist-tool)

Located in `src/cmd/dist/`, this tool orchestrates the entire build:

- **`bootstrap`**: Rebuilds everything (toolchains 1–3, stdlib, commands)
- **`install`**: Installs individual packages or commands
- **`clean`**: Removes all built artifacts
- **`test`**: Runs the test suite
- **`list`**: Enumerates supported platforms
- **`env`**: Prints build environment variables
- **`banner`**: Displays installation information

### Distribution Packaging [Link to this section](https://www.augmentcode.com/open-source/golang/go\#distribution-packaging)

The `cmd/distpack` tool creates release artifacts:

- **Binary distributions**: Platform-specific `.tar.gz` (Unix) or `.zip` (Windows)
- **Source distribution**: Platform-independent `.src.tar.gz`
- **Module distributions**: Go module format for `GOTOOLCHAIN` support

Invoked via `make.bash -distpack`, it outputs to `$GOROOT/pkg/distpack/`. Cross-compilation is supported by setting `GOOS` and `GOARCH` before running `make.bash`.

### Cross-Compilation [Link to this section](https://www.augmentcode.com/open-source/golang/go\#cross-compilation)

Set environment variables before building:

```bash
GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm64 ./make.bash
```

The build system automatically handles host vs. target architecture differences, building host tools first when needed.

### Key Build Variables [Link to this section](https://www.augmentcode.com/open-source/golang/go\#key-build-variables)

- `GOROOT`: Installation root directory
- `GOOS`/`GOARCH`: Target operating system and architecture
- `GOHOSTOS`/`GOHOSTARCH`: Build machine OS and architecture
- `GOEXPERIMENT`: Enables experimental features during Toolchain 2 build
- `GO_DISTFLAGS`: Additional flags passed to `dist bootstrap`

### Unit Testing [Link to this section](https://www.augmentcode.com/open-source/golang/go\#unit-testing)

Go's testing framework is built into the `testing` package and integrated with `go test`. Tests are functions matching `func TestXxx(*testing.T)` in files ending with `_test.go`. The `*testing.T` type provides methods for assertions and logging:

- `t.Error()`, `t.Errorf()` \- Report failures without stopping
- `t.Fatal()`, `t.Fatalf()` \- Report failures and stop immediately
- `t.Log()`, `t.Logf()` \- Output diagnostic information
- `t.Skip()`, `t.Skipf()` \- Skip the test
- `t.Cleanup()` \- Register cleanup functions

Tests can be run in white-box mode (same package) or black-box mode (separate `_test` package). Use `-run` flag to filter tests by regex pattern.

### Benchmarking [Link to this section](https://www.augmentcode.com/open-source/golang/go\#benchmarking)

Benchmark functions follow `func BenchmarkXxx(*testing.B)` and measure performance. The `*testing.B` type provides:

- `b.Loop()` \- Iterate the benchmark body; only the loop body is timed
- `b.ReportAllocs()` \- Include memory allocation statistics
- `b.RunParallel()` \- Run benchmark in parallel across multiple goroutines

Run benchmarks with `go test -bench=.` and control duration with `-benchtime`. Memory profiling is enabled via `-benchmem`.

### Fuzzing [Link to this section](https://www.augmentcode.com/open-source/golang/go\#fuzzing)

Fuzz tests use `func FuzzXxx(*testing.F)` to generate and test random inputs. The `*testing.F` type provides:

- `f.Add(args...)` \- Add seed corpus entries
- `f.Fuzz(fn)` \- Define the fuzz target function
- `f.Failed()`, `f.Name()` \- Query test state

Fuzz tests discover bugs by generating inputs and minimizing failures. Run with `go test -fuzz=FuzzXxx` and control duration with `-fuzztime`.

### Profiling with PProf [Link to this section](https://www.augmentcode.com/open-source/golang/go\#profiling-with-pprof)

The `runtime/pprof` package enables profiling. Built-in profiles include:

- **CPU** \- `pprof.StartCPUProfile()` / `pprof.StopCPUProfile()` \- Samples CPU usage at 100 Hz
- **Heap** \- `pprof.Lookup("heap")` \- Memory allocations of live objects
- **Allocs** \- `pprof.Lookup("allocs")` \- All allocations since program start
- **Goroutine** \- `pprof.Lookup("goroutine")` \- Stack traces of all goroutines
- **Block** \- `pprof.Lookup("block")` \- Synchronization blocking time
- **Mutex** \- `pprof.Lookup("mutex")` \- Lock contention

Enable profiling in tests with `-cpuprofile`, `-memprofile`, `-blockprofile`, `-mutexprofile` flags. Analyze profiles with `go tool pprof`.

### Execution Tracing [Link to this section](https://www.augmentcode.com/open-source/golang/go\#execution-tracing-1)

The `runtime/trace` package captures detailed execution events. Generate traces with `go test -trace=trace.out` or `runtime/trace.Start()`. View traces with `go tool trace trace.out`, which opens an interactive web UI showing:

- Goroutine execution timeline
- Processor utilization
- Network and synchronization blocking
- Garbage collection events

Extract pprof-compatible profiles from traces using `go tool trace -pprof=TYPE trace.out`.

### Code Coverage [Link to this section](https://www.augmentcode.com/open-source/golang/go\#code-coverage)

The `cmd/cover` tool instruments source code to track execution. Generate coverage profiles with `go test -coverprofile=cover.out`. Analyze coverage with:

- `go tool cover -html=cover.out` \- Interactive HTML report
- `go tool cover -func=cover.out` \- Per-function coverage statistics

Coverage modes: `set` (executed/not), `count` (execution count), `atomic` (thread-safe counting).

### Debugging [Link to this section](https://www.augmentcode.com/open-source/golang/go\#debugging)

The `debug` package provides symbol and binary format support:

- `debug/dwarf` \- DWARF debug information
- `debug/elf`, `debug/macho`, `debug/pe` \- Binary format parsing
- `debug/gosym` \- Go symbol tables and PC line tables

Use `go tool objdump` to disassemble binaries and `go tool addr2line` to map addresses to source locations.
