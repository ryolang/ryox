**Ryo /ˈraɪoʊ/: Productive, Safe, Fast.**

Ryo is a new, statically-typed, compiled programming language designed for developers who love the **simplicity of Python** but need the **performance and memory safety** guarantees of languages like Rust or Go, without the steep learning curve.

Build reliable and efficient **web backends, CLI tools, and scripts** with an approachable syntax, powerful compile-time checks, and a straightforward concurrency model using Go-inspired channels. Ryo manages memory safely via ownership and borrowing (simplified, no manual lifetimes) **without a garbage collector**, ensuring predictable performance and eliminating entire classes of bugs.

**This project contains the source code for the Ryo compiler, standard library, and tooling.**

**Status:** Ryo is currently in the **early stages of development** (pre-alpha). The language design is stabilizing, but the compiler is under active construction. It is **not yet ready for production use**. We welcome contributors!

## Why Ryo?

*   **🐍 Simple & Productive:** Write clear, readable code with a clean syntax inspired by Python (tabs, f-strings, tuples, built-in `print`). Reduce boilerplate and focus on your logic.
*   **🛡️ Safe & Reliable:** Compile-time memory safety via "Ownership Lite" prevents dangling pointers, data races, and use-after-free errors without a GC. Explicit error handling with `Result` and `?` makes code robust. No `null` thanks to `Optional`.
*   **🚀 Fast & Efficient:** Compiled to native code using **Cranelift** for excellent performance. No garbage collection pauses mean predictable speed. Efficient Go-inspired CSP concurrency (`spawn`/`chan`/`select`) for scalable applications.
*   **🧩 Modern Tooling:** Integrated package manager (`ryo`), fast compiler, interactive REPL (JIT), built-in testing framework.
*   **✨ Compile-Time Power (`comptime`):** Run code at compile time for metaprogramming, configuration loading, and pre-computation without runtime cost or complex macros.
*   **🧩 Pragmatic Interoperability:** Designed with C FFI for leveraging existing native code. (Future goals include exploring closer integration with ecosystems like Python).

## Features Overview

*   **Memory Management:** Ownership & Borrowing (Simplified, "Ownership Lite"), No GC, RAII (`Drop`), Immutable-by-Default variables for safer code.
*   **Concurrency:** Go-inspired CSP (Communicating Sequential Processes) via `spawn`, `chan`, `select`
*   **Syntax:** Python-inspired, tab-indented, expressions, statements
*   **Types:** Static typing, type inference (for `var = val`), primitives (`int`, `float`, `bool`, `str`, `char`), tuples, `struct`, `enum` (ADTs), `trait` (static dispatch initially)
*   **Error Handling:** `Result[T, E]` and `Optional[T]` enums, `?` operator, `panic` (aborts)
*   **Compile-Time Execution:** `comptime` blocks and functions
*   **Tooling:** `ryo` command (compiler, runner, REPL, package manager frontend), `ryopkg` logic integrated, Cranelift backend (AOT/JIT/Wasm)
*   **FFI:** C interoperability via `extern "C"` and `unsafe` blocks, `ffi` stdlib module. (Future Goal: Explore deeper integration with other language ecosystems like Python).
*   **Standard Library:** Modular packages (`io`, `str`, `collections`, `http`, `json`, `os`, etc.)

## Quick Example

```ryo
# src/main.ryo
import net.http
import encoding.json

struct User:
    id: int
    name: str

# Assume JSON encoding logic exists (e.g., via a trait)
# impl json.ToJson for User { ... }

#: Simple handler to return users as JSON
fn handle_users(req: http.Request) -> http.Response {
    # In a real app, fetch from DB
    let users = [
        User{ id: 1, name: "Alice" },
        User{ id: 2, name: "Bob" },
    ]
    # Respond with JSON, using ? to propagate potential encoding errors
    return http.Response.json(users)?
}

#: Main application entry point
fn main() -> Result[(), http.Error] {
    server = http.Server.new()

    # Define routes - handlers likely run via spawn internally
    server.handle("/users", handle_users)
    server.handle("/", fn(req) { http.Response.text("Hello from Ryo!") })

    addr = "127.0.0.1:8080"
    print(f"Server listening on {addr}")
    server.listen(addr)? # Start the server

    return Ok(())
}

```

Run with: `ryo run` (after building the `ryo` tool)

## Getting Started & Installation

Ryo is under heavy development. Currently, installation requires building from source.

**(Instructions for building from source will go here)**

```bash
# Example build steps (replace with actual steps)
git clone https://github.com/ryolang/ryo.git
cd ryo
cargo build --release
# Add target/release to your PATH
export PATH="$(pwd)/target/release:$PATH"

# Verify
ryo --version
```

Once installed, you can create and run projects:

```bash
# Create a new project
ryo new my_app
cd my_app

# Edit src/main.ryo
# ...

# Build and run
ryo run
```
