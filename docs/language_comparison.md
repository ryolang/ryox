## Detailed Comparisons

### Ryo vs Python

**Similarities:**
- Indentation-based code blocks
- Clean, readable syntax with minimal punctuation
- Strong emphasis on developer ergonomics
- Similar control flow structures (`if/elif/else`, `for`, function definitions)

**Key Differences:**

| Feature | Python | Ryo | Advantage |
|---------|--------|-----|-----------|
| **Type System** | Dynamic typing | Static typing with inference | Ryo: Catch errors at compile time |
| **Performance** | Interpreted | Compiled to native code | Ryo: 10-100x faster execution |
| **Memory Management** | Garbage collection | Ownership with borrowing | Ryo: Predictable memory usage, no GC pauses |
| **Concurrency** | GIL limitations, async/await | Native async/await with true parallelism | Ryo: Better multi-core utilization |
| **Deployment** | Requires Python runtime | Self-contained binaries | Ryo: Easier deployment |

**Code Example - Error Handling:**

**Python:**
```python
def divide(a, b):
    try:
        return a / b
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        return None

result = divide(10, 2)
if result is not None:
    print(f"Result: {result}")
else:
    print("Division failed")
```

**Ryo:**
```ryo
module math:
    error DivisionByZero

fn divide(a: int, b: int) -> math.DivisionByZero!int:
    if b == 0:
        return math.DivisionByZero
    return a / b

result = divide(10, 2) catch |e|:
    match e:
        math.DivisionByZero:
            print("Division failed: division by zero")
    return

print(f"Result: {result}")
```

**Migration Path:**
- Start with familiar Python-like syntax
- Add type annotations gradually
- Learn Result/Optional types for error handling
- Understand ownership for memory management

### Ryo vs Rust

**Similarities:**
- Memory safety without garbage collection
- Ownership and borrowing concepts
- Result types for error handling
- Pattern matching with `match`
- Performance-oriented compilation

**Key Differences:**

| Feature | Rust | Ryo | Advantage |
|---------|------|-----|-----------|
| **Syntax** | C-like with braces | Python-like with indentation | Ryo: More readable, less visual noise |
| **Borrowing** | Complex lifetime system | Scope-based borrowing only | Ryo: Easier to learn and use |
| **Learning Curve** | Steep | Gentler | Ryo: Faster developer onboarding |
| **Error Messages** | Can be overwhelming | Designed for clarity | Ryo: Better developer experience |
| **Expressiveness** | Highly expressive | Simpler, more constrained | Rust: More powerful, Ryo: Easier |

**Code Example - Memory Management:**

**Rust:**
```rust
fn process_data<'a>(data: &'a str) -> &'a str {
    // Complex lifetime annotations needed
    data.trim()
}

fn main() {
    let input = String::from("  hello  ");
    let result = process_data(&input);
    println!("{}", result);
}
```

**Ryo:**
```ryo
fn process_data(data: &str) -> &str:
    # No lifetime annotations needed - scope-based
    return data.trim()

fn main():
    input = "  hello  "
    result = process_data(&input)
    print(result)
```

**Migration Path:**
- Familiar ownership concepts transfer directly
- Simpler borrowing rules (no explicit lifetimes)
- Similar performance characteristics
- Pattern matching works the same way

### Ryo vs Go

**Similarities:**
- Emphasis on simplicity and minimalism
- Focus on practical programming
- Excellent tooling and package management
- Clear error handling patterns

**Key Differences:**

| Feature | Go | Ryo | Advantage |
|---------|----|----|-----------|
| **Memory Safety** | Manual memory management, GC | Ownership with compile-time checks | Ryo: Memory safety without GC overhead |
| **Type System** | Simple but limited | Static with inference and generics | Ryo: More expressive while staying simple |
| **Error Handling** | `if err != nil` pattern | Error types with `try`/`catch` | Ryo: More ergonomic error handling |
| **Generics** | Recently added, limited | Designed from the ground up | Ryo: More powerful generic system |
| **Concurrency** | Goroutines and channels | Async/await with structured concurrency | Both: Excellent, different approaches |

**Code Example - Concurrency:**

**Go:**
```go
func fetchData(url string, ch chan<- string) {
    // Simulate network request
    time.Sleep(100 * time.Millisecond)
    ch <- "data from " + url
}

func main() {
    ch := make(chan string, 2)
    go fetchData("url1", ch)
    go fetchData("url2", ch)
    
    for i := 0; i < 2; i++ {
        fmt.Println(<-ch)
    }
}
```

**Ryo:**
```ryo
async fn fetch_data(url: str) -> str:
    # Simulate network request
    await sleep(100)
    return f"data from {url}"

async fn main():
    results = await gather([
        fetch_data("url1"),
        fetch_data("url2")
    ])
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)
```

**Migration Path:**
- Similar philosophy of simplicity
- Async/await instead of goroutines (familiar to many developers)
- More expressive type system
- Similar tooling and package management concepts
