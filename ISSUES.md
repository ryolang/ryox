# Known Issues

Compiler issues identified during source review. Each entry is independently actionable; severity reflects impact on correctness, future feature work, or code health — not user impact today (the compiler is pre-alpha).

Resolved entries are **removed** from this file. Language-visible decisions behind a resolution are recorded in `docs/specification.md`; for anything else, look at `git log` (or this file's history) for the removed entry. `I-xxx` references in code comments and `docs/dev/architecture_analysis.md` may point to removed entries.

## 🟡 Correctness / Hygiene

### I-032 — IfStmt is statement-only, no expression-level conditional

**Files:** `ryo-core/src/ast.rs`, `ryo-frontend/src/parser.rs`, `ryo-frontend/src/sema/`, `ryo-backend/src/codegen/`
**Summary:** `if`/`elif`/`else` is a statement (`StmtKind::IfStmt`), not an expression. There is no way to write `x = if cond: a else: b` (ternary/conditional expression). The spec envisions `if` as an expression in certain contexts. Current codegen emits void for IfStmt and uses no phi-merge for values across branches.
**Resolution:** Add `ExprKind::IfExpr` when the spec finalizes expression-if syntax. Codegen would use block params (like BoolAnd/BoolOr already do) to merge values at the join point. Watch codegen's value memoizer here: a Cranelift `Value` materialized in one block cannot be re-read from a block it does not dominate, so the memoized repr must be anchored to (or re-materialized at) the merge point.

### I-033 — Variables declared inside if/elif/else branches are not visible after the statement

**Files:** `ryo-frontend/src/sema/stmt.rs` (`analyze_block`)
**Summary:** Each branch of an if/elif/else creates a child scope. Variables declared inside a branch are dropped when the branch scope ends. There is no "variable promotion" — even if all branches declare `x: int`, `x` is not available after the if statement. This is the correct scoping semantics for now, but may surprise users expecting Python-style scoping where if-branches don't create a new scope.
**Resolution:** This is intentional for M8b. If user feedback requests Python-style flat scoping, revisit as a language design decision (requires approval per CLAUDE.md escalation rules).

### I-011 — Manual error enum where `thiserror` would suffice

**Files:** `ryo-core/src/errors.rs` (33 lines)
**Summary:** Hand-rolled `enum CompilerError` with manual `Display` and `From<io::Error>` impls. `thiserror` would cut ~20 lines and make variants more uniform.
**Resolution:** Add `thiserror`, derive `Error` and `Display`, drop the hand-written impls.

### I-013 — `--emit` flag surface is fragmented across subcommands

**Files:** `ryo/src/main.rs`, `ryo-driver/src/pipeline.rs`
**Summary:** `lex`, `parse`, `ir` are separate subcommands. Each stage already exists and is wired up; users would benefit from a single `ryo build --emit=tokens|ast|hir|clif|obj` surface (mirroring `zig build-exe -femit-…`).
**Resolution:** Unify under one subcommand with an `--emit` flag.

### I-018 — `TypeId` is a newtype, not a typed enum

**Files:** `ryo-core/src/types.rs` (`TypeId`)
**Summary:** The UIR/TIR pipeline redesign originally called for `TypeId` to become an `enum { Void = 0, Bool = 1, ..., Error = 4, Dynamic(NonZeroU32) }` so primitive matches are exhaustive at compile time and the `pool.int()` accessor disappears. The design allowed a fallback to a plain `Copy` newtype if the enum encoding fights the borrow checker, which is what we shipped. Cost: the `TypeKind::Tuple` arm we added in `cranelift_type_for` and a couple of sema sites are not statically guaranteed to be covered when a new primitive lands.
**Resolution:** Re-attempt the enum encoding using `repr(u32)` + `Dynamic(NonZeroU32)` once the borrow-checker pain points (mostly around `pool.kind` returning a value that contains a `TypeId`) are characterised. Low priority — the matches we have today still go through `TypeKind`, which *is* exhaustive, so the gap is small.

### I-019 — `tuple_elements_vec` allocates a `Vec` per call

**Files:** `ryo-core/src/types.rs` (`tuple_elements_vec`)
**Summary:** The accessor copies the element-id slice out of `extra` rather than returning a borrowed view, because `TypeId` is not `#[repr(transparent)]` over `u32` and the unsafe transmute to `&[TypeId]` would be UB without it. Today the function is called only by `Display` for diagnostics and by tests; not a hot path.
**Resolution:** Tag `TypeId` with `#[repr(transparent)]` and expose `tuple_elements(id) -> &[TypeId]` alongside the copying accessor. Migrate non-perf-critical callers to it lazily. Defer until tuple codegen lands and the accessor shows up in a profile.

### I-021 — `bool` lowered as `types::I8` will mis-ABI across FFI boundaries

**Files:** `ryo-backend/src/codegen/mod.rs` (`cranelift_type_for`)
**Summary:** `TypeKind::Bool` maps to Cranelift `I8`. Fine for internal logic, but C ABIs typically pass `_Bool` zero/sign-extended to a full register (often i32 on SysV, register-width on Win64). Passing or returning our raw `I8` across an FFI call would leave the upper bits undefined from the callee's perspective.
**Resolution:** When FFI lands, insert explicit `uext` (zero-extension) on bool arguments at call sites and `ireduce` on bool returns, per the target ABI. Decide at the FFI design stage whether `bool` keeps its `I8` storage type and only widens at the boundary, or becomes register-width throughout. Latent until FFI exists.

### I-024 — Single `float` type, no `float32` / `float64` distinction

**Files:** `ryo-core/src/types.rs` (`Tag::Float`, `TypeKind::Float`), `ryo-backend/src/codegen/mod.rs` (`cranelift_type_for`)
**Summary:** M7 ships one float type (`float`), lowered to Cranelift `F64`. Matches today's `int` (one width, machine-word). Users who need 32-bit floats for memory, GPU work, or C interop have no surface syntax to ask for one.
**Resolution:** Add `Tag::Float32` alongside the existing `Tag::Float` (which becomes `Float64` semantically), expose `: float32` / `: float64` annotations, and pick one as the default for unannotated `1.5`-style literals. Coordinate with the broader numeric-tower design (sized integers, `usize` / `isize`) so the widening story is consistent across types.

### I-025 — No implicit `int` ↔ `float` promotion or conversion functions

**Files:** `ryo-frontend/src/sema/expr.rs` (`check_binary_op` mixed-type branch)
**Summary:** `1 + 2.0` is a hard `TypeMismatch` error; users must spell every conversion explicitly, but there are no conversion intrinsics yet either — `int(x)` and `float(x)` don't exist. The result is that mixed numeric arithmetic is currently *unspellable*. Acceptable today (no programs need it), but blocks any real numeric workload.
**Resolution:** Land conversion intrinsics first (`int(float) -> int`, `float(int) -> float`, with Cranelift `fcvt_to_sint_sat` / `fcvt_from_sint`). At that point introduce limited widening (e.g. `int + float -> float` only when the int is a literal, Swift stance). Document.

### I-026 — Float modulo (`%` on `float`) rejected

**Files:** `ryo-frontend/src/sema/expr.rs` (`check_binary_op` is_modulo branch)
**Summary:** `1.0 % 2.0` produces `"modulo operator '%' not supported for type 'float'"`. The plan deferred this because `fmod` has surprising semantics on negatives and on NaN, and there is no concrete user demand yet.
**Resolution:** When a real use case appears, decide between `libm::fmod` (C / IEEE remainder semantics) and a `frem`-style "sign of dividend" lowering, then add a `TirTag::FMod` and route `% on float` through it in sema. Document the chosen semantics in `docs/specification.md` before implementing.

### I-027 — Restricted float literal grammar

**Files:** `ryo-frontend/src/lexer.rs` (`RawToken::Float` regex `[0-9]+\.[0-9]+`)
**Summary:** Float literals must have digits on both sides of the dot. None of `.5`, `5.`, `1e10`, `1.5e-3`, `1_000_000.0` parse. Sufficient for M7's example programs but obviously incomplete.
**Resolution:** Extend the regex to cover `[0-9]+(_[0-9]+)*(\.[0-9]+(_[0-9]+)*)?([eE][+-]?[0-9]+)?` (or break it into named sub-patterns). Mirror the same underscore + exponent treatment for integer literals at the same time so the two grammars stay parallel. Watch out for ambiguities with method-call syntax (`5.bit_count()`) once methods land.

### I-154 — No way to name infinity (or NaN) in Ryo source

**Files:** `ryo-frontend/src/lexer.rs` (`RawToken::Float` regex, cf. I-027), `ryo-frontend/src/builtins.rs`, `ryo-frontend/src/sema/`, `docs/specification.md`
**Summary:** There is no source-level spelling for IEEE infinity or NaN. The float literal grammar (`[0-9]+\.[0-9]+`, I-027) cannot express either — infinity has no decimal spelling, and the grammar has no exponent notation. IEEE edge cases are reachable at runtime (`1.0 / 0.0` yields `+inf`, see `examples/float_zero_div.ryo`) but can only be *detected* indirectly via identities like `x > 0.0 and x * 2.0 == x`, which is opaque and fragile. Almost no language spells infinity as a literal (Rust, Go, Python, C all use named constants), so this is a naming gap, not a grammar gap.
**Resolution:** Add `inf` as a predefined name that sema resolves to `FloatLit(f64::INFINITY.to_bits())` — same mechanism as the other builtins, no new literal grammar. Decide `nan` deliberately rather than by default: a `nan` constant makes `nan == nan` false in surface syntax, which is a real footgun; consider whether `x != x` suffices for NaN detection instead. This is a language design change — it requires explicit spec approval and a paragraph in the specification's literals/constants section before implementation.

### I-028 — No `print(float)` (or `print` on non-string types)

**Files:** `ryo-frontend/src/builtins.rs`, `ryo-frontend/src/sema/builtins.rs` (`check_print_args`), `ryo-backend/src/codegen/expr.rs` (print emission)
**Summary:** Float arithmetic has no observability beyond the program exit code. `print` is an ordinary runtime call (`ryo_print`) but accepts only `str`/`strview` arguments. Inspecting a float at runtime requires either a formatter (`f"{x:.2}"`) or polymorphic `print`, neither of which exists.
**Resolution:** Lands when the runtime gains `print_f64` (or a polymorphic dispatch) and `check_print_args` accepts `float` arguments.

### I-029 — AST loses `Eq` because `Literal::Float` carries an `f64`

**Files:** `ryo-core/src/ast.rs` (`Literal`, `Expression`, `Statement`, `Program`, `StmtKind`, `ExprKind`, `VarDecl`, `FunctionDef`)
**Summary:** `Literal::Float(f64)` cannot derive `Eq` (NaN ≠ NaN), and `Eq` derivation propagates up the containment chain, so every AST struct that transitively holds a `Literal` had to drop the `Eq` derive. No consumer hashes or `Eq`-compares AST nodes today, so the change is currently invisible.
**Resolution:** If a future pass needs `HashMap<Expression, _>` or similar, introduce a `FloatBits(u64)` newtype that derives `Eq + Hash` on the bit pattern and *also* implements `PartialEq` with IEEE semantics. Wrap `f64` inside `Literal::Float` with it. Until then, leave the derives off.

### I-034 — Builtin name comparison uses string compare instead of interned ID

**Files:** `ryo-frontend/src/sema/call.rs` (`check_call`), `ryo-frontend/src/sema/builtins.rs` (`emit_builtin_call`)
**Summary:** `sema.pool.str(name_id) == "assert"` (and similar for `"panic"`, `"print"`) does a string dereference and byte comparison on every `check_call` invocation. Since the intern pool already deduplicates strings, comparing `name_id == assert_id` (where `assert_id` is cached once during builtin registration or sema init) would be a direct integer compare. Negligible today with three builtins and small programs, but the cost scales linearly with both the number of call sites and the number of builtins. Additional sites found in the M8.4.2 audit: `sema/builtins.rs:240` compares `pool.str(name_id) == "str"` for the `str(view)` materialize intercept (explicitly *not* a `BUILTINS`-table entry, so a table-driven fix misses them), codegen detects `main` by `pool.str(tir.name) == "main"` at `codegen/mod.rs:492, :531, :602, :997` (line refs refreshed 2026-08-24), and `sema/mod.rs:300` does `name.starts_with("__ryo_")` per decl. New sites from the 2026-08 arena-perf review: `astgen.rs:355` compares `pool.str(iterator.name) != "range"` per for-loop, `astgen.rs:234` hash-probes `pool.find_str("main")` per function def (the already-interned id could be threaded through), and `sema/stmt.rs:47,:196` runs `check_reserved_builtin` (`sema/call.rs:255`) per VarDecl.
**Resolution:** Cache `StringId`s for each builtin name (e.g., in `Sema` or alongside `builtins::BUILTINS`) and match on the id instead of the string. Same applies to the codegen-side `name_str == "print"` comparisons. Also intern `"str"`, `"main"`, and the `"__ryo_"` prefix check — the materialize intercept and `main` detection are not covered by a BUILTINS-table-driven fix.

### I-037 — Panic/Assert mechanism lacks `#file` / `#line` intrinsic expansion

**Files:** `ryo-frontend/src/sema/builtins.rs`, `ryo-backend/src/codegen/expr.rs`
**Summary:** The `panic` implementation bakes the source location (line, column) directly into a unique formatted string literal per call site at compile time. If a user asserts in ten places, the binary interns ten distinct copies of the assertion string format.
**Resolution:** Add macro-style `#file` and `#line` intrinsics or special UIR nodes (e.g. `InstTag::FileLoc`) to sema/codegen. `__ryo_panic` can then take `line` and `col` as integer arguments and construct the format string dynamically via `libc` functions or standard runtime printing, sharing the user's message string across sites.

### I-038 — Assert checks cannot be stripped in Release mode

**Files:** `ryo-frontend/src/sema/`, `ryo-backend/src/codegen/`
**Summary:** Ryo has no mechanism to strip `assert` checks in `--release` configurations. The condition evaluates and branches at runtime unconditionally.
**Resolution:** Introduce a compilation mode flag (`--release` vs `--debug`) and strip `assert` AST/UIR nodes during semantic analysis when building for release. Provide a `precondition` or `fatal` variant that explicitly ignores the release flag for mandatory bounds checks.

### I-039 — `panic` provides no stack unwinding or stack traces

**Files:** `ryo-backend/src/codegen/expr.rs` (`__ryo_panic` call emission)
**Summary:** A panic terminates execution instantly (`exit(101)`) and prints only the line/col of the `panic()` or `assert()` call site. If a shared utility function calls `panic`, the user gets no traceback to the caller.
**Resolution:** Add DWARF debug info generation to Cranelift (`.debug_line`, `.debug_info`, `.debug_frame`). Implement a simple stack walker in the runtime (e.g., `backtrace` from `libc` or via DWARF frame unwinding) to print the call stack inside `__ryo_panic`.
**Note:** DWARF emission is the shared prerequisite. Once it lands, interactive debugging via DAP ([Debug Adapter Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/debug-adapter-protocol/)) comes nearly for free — lldb already speaks DAP, so VS Code / JetBrains attach without Ryo-specific work. The stack-trace feature in `__ryo_panic` is additive runtime work on top of that same DWARF foundation.

### I-040 — `for-range` arity: only 2-arg form supported

**Files:** `ryo-frontend/src/parser.rs` (for-range parser)
**Summary:** Python allows `range(stop)` (implied start=0) and `range(start, stop, step)`. Ryo's parser strictly enforces `range(start, end)` (exactly 2 arguments). This is documented v0.1 behaviour. Users coming from Python will inevitably try `for i in range(10):` and receive a generic arity error.
**Resolution:** Consider supporting `range(end)` as sugar for `range(0, end)` in a future milestone. The 3-arg `range(start, end, step)` form requires a more complex increment block in codegen. Both are additive and non-breaking.

### I-041 — `range` is a syntactic hack, not a function

**Files:** `ryo-frontend/src/builtins.rs`, `ryo-frontend/src/sema/`
**Summary:** `range(0, 5)` is hardcoded as a reserved keyword in semantic analysis rather than a standard library function. If a generic `for element in collection:` loop is implemented in the future, the `range` hardcoding will need to be removed in favor of a true `RangeIterator` protocol.
**Resolution:** Defer until Structs, Generics, and Iterator Interfaces are formally designed and implemented. Once they exist, remove the specific `range` semantic checks and transition it to a standard library function.

### I-042 — For loop codegen needs to be desugared into while loops

**Files:** `ryo-backend/src/codegen/mod.rs` (`generate_for_range` :1377)
**Summary:** Currently, `for-range` loops have bespoke code generation that manually emits basic blocks, jump instructions, and raw counter increments. When general iterators are added, loops should be desugared during the AST-to-UIR phase into standard `while` loops that call `.next()`.
**Resolution:** Once iterators land, remove the `generate_for_range` codegen entirely and rely on standard `while` codegen to emit loops.

### I-047 — UIR `is_move` field is a pass-through

**Files:** `ryo-core/src/uir.rs` (`UirParam`), `ryo-frontend/src/astgen.rs`, `ryo-frontend/src/sema/`
**Summary:** `is_move` is threaded lexer → parser → AST → UIR → TIR. The UIR copy is never read: astgen propagates the AST flag in, sema reads it back out into `TirParam`, and no UIR pass inspects it. UIR is structural lowering with no semantic meaning, so `UirParam::is_move` is dead weight that exists only to bridge two layers it shouldn't.
**Resolution:** Drop `UirParam::is_move`. Sema can read the flag straight from the AST `FuncBody` (or via a side-channel keyed by FuncBody) when it constructs `TirParam`. Wait until any other UIR-level pass needs the flag before re-introducing it.

### I-073 — Zig download has no integrity verification and races concurrent installs

**Files:** `ryo-backend/src/toolchain.rs` (`download_zig` :54-112)
**Summary:** The tarball is streamed HTTPS → XZ → tar with no sha256/signature check even though ziglang.org publishes shasums and `.minisig` files — a supply-chain gap. The fixed temp dir `.zig-{v}-downloading` (:62) lets two concurrent first-runs delete each other's in-flight download (`remove_dir_all` at :67), and `remove_dir_all(&desired_path)` (:101) can delete a working toolchain out from under another running compile.
**Resolution:** Hardcode the three pinned sha256s (one per supported target) and verify before extraction; use a pid-suffixed temp dir (matching `runtime_lib.rs`'s discipline) and atomic rename; never delete `desired_path` until the replacement is staged.

### I-076 — `str` ABI is hardcoded to 64-bit layout

**Files:** `ryo-backend/src/codegen/mod.rs` (`STR_SLOT_SIZE`/`VIEW_SLOT_SIZE`/`OFF_PTR`/`OFF_LEN` :40-45), `ryo-backend/src/codegen/expr.rs` (`types::I64` len/cap :1155-1170), `runtime/src/lib.rs` (`RyoStrFat`)
**Summary:** Every str stack slot hardcodes 24 bytes / align 3 / offsets 0,8,16 (consts at `codegen/mod.rs:40-45`), and `len`/`cap` are hardcoded `types::I64` (`codegen/expr.rs:1155-1170`) while `ptr` is pointer-sized. On a 32-bit target, caller and callee layouts silently mismatch.
**Resolution:** Centralize the fat-pointer layout in one place (offsets and size computed from `module.target_config().pointer_type()`) and mirror it in the runtime. Prerequisite for any 32-bit target; interacts with I-021 (bool FFI width) when FFI lands.

### I-079 — Unary minus on `float` is rejected

**Files:** `ryo-frontend/src/sema/expr.rs` (`InstTag::Neg` arm :143-177)
**Summary:** The `Neg` arm only handles `TypeKind::Int` (`INeg`); `-x` on a float operand emits `UnsupportedOperator` even though float arithmetic is otherwise fully supported. Asymmetric and undocumented; smells like an oversight rather than a decision.
**Resolution:** Add `TirTag::FNeg` lowering to Cranelift `fneg` and accept `Float` in the `Neg` arm.

### I-080 — UIR/TIR `extra`-layout modules are duplicated with subtly different layouts

**Files:** `ryo-core/src/uir.rs` (`var_decl_extra` etc.), `ryo-core/src/tir.rs` (`call_extra` :337-342, `var_decl_extra` :355-362, `assign_extra`/… :370-418)
**Summary:** tir.rs re-defines near-identical `extra`-layout modules with different layouts: `call_extra` appends a modes tail; `var_decl_extra` drops the `TY` slot (`LEN: 3` vs uir's `4`). Same names, same constants, different meanings — a footgun when editing one side. `ExtraRange` itself is also byte-duplicated (`uir.rs:107-118` vs `tir.rs:87-98`), and `IfStmt` has no layout doc module at all in tir.rs (:677-715).
**Resolution:** Unify the shared pieces (`ExtraRange` at minimum) in one module; rename or document the layout differences explicitly; add the missing `if_stmt_extra` doc module.

### I-158 — `string_slicing` JIT regressed +53% with the packed-u128 runtime ABI (AOT flat)

**Files:** `ryo-backend/src/codegen/` (JIT module path), `benchmarks/string_slicing/`
**Summary:** After the packed-u128 string runtime ABI change (commit `7d0a047`, string-producing runtime functions return `{ptr, len}` packed in `u128` instead of writing through an out-pointer stack slot), the `string_slicing` benchmark's JIT leg regressed from ~6.6 ms to ~10.1 ms (+53%, reproduced across runs) while AOT stayed flat (~4.9 → ~5.4 ms). Recorded in `benchmarks/string_slicing/README.md`. Cause not investigated — candidates: JIT code layout/instruction-count change around the view-slice call path, or extra `ireduce`/`ushr` unpack work that the JIT's lower optimization level doesn't fold.
**Resolution:** Profile the JIT leg (e.g. Samply per `benchmarks/README.md`), compare CLIF for `count_fox` pre/post `7d0a047`, and either reclaim the delta or document it as accepted. Re-run the suite checkpoint per the manual checkpoint convention when resolved.

### I-159 — W0001 dead-store false positive: method-call receiver not counted as a use

**Files:** `ryo-frontend/src/ownership/walk.rs` (:296-305), `ryo-frontend/src/ownership/mod.rs` (:577-581)
**Summary:** `t = int_to_str(i) + "!"; total += t.len()` triggers W0001 ("`t` declared but never used") — the ownership pass's dead-store tracking does not count a method-call receiver read (`t.len()`) as a use. Reproduces on `benchmarks/many_small_strings/many_small_strings.ryo` (the only suite member that hits it; sibling benchmarks are clean). User-visible false-positive warning on a shipped benchmark.
**Resolution:** Count method-call receiver reads as uses in the dead-store/last-use walk (check how `StrLen`/`MethodCall`-shaped TIR reads propagate), then pin with an ownership test for `x = <expr>; … x.len()` staying warning-free.

## 🟢 Cleanup

### I-091 — UIR/TIR view decoders allocate a `Vec` per decode

**Files:** `ryo-core/src/uir.rs` (`call_view` :870-886, `if_stmt_view` :1004-1046, `body_stmts` :344, `while_loop_view` :942, `for_range_view` :956, `method_call_view` :981), `ryo-core/src/tir.rs` (`call_view`), `ryo-backend/src/codegen/expr.rs` (call view args/modes)
**Summary:** Every accessor decode collects refs out of `extra` into a fresh `Vec<InstRef>`/`Vec<TirRef>`, and `body_stmts()` collects a slice that is already contiguous. Sema and codegen call these in their hottest loops. Multipliers found in the 2026-08 arena-perf review: `Tir::walk_operands` (`tir.rs:1194-1266`) decodes views per visited instruction, so every `collect_reachable` costs several Vec allocs per inst; sema calls `uir.body_stmts(body)` twice per function (`sema/mod.rs:485-486`); ownership calls `tir.body_stmts()` per whole-body-walk query (`ownership/frees.rs:28, :208`, `ownership/loops.rs:67, :128, :249, :307`). Additionally `ExtraRange.len` is write-only metadata (decoders re-derive counts from inline `argc` words) — a second source of truth.
**Resolution:** Return borrowed slices (`&[InstRef]` over `extra`) or `impl Iterator` from the views; `body_stmts` can be a slice iter directly. Add `assert_eq!(size_of::<Inst>(), 24)` before any `InstData` refactor.

### I-092 — Sema per-function and per-call allocation churn

**Files:** `ryo-frontend/src/sema/` (`FuncCtx` `mod.rs:515`, `check_call` `call.rs:82-97`, method calls `expr.rs:220`)
**Summary:** (a) `inst_map` is `vec![None; uir.instructions.len()]` — the program-wide UIR size — allocated per function; (b) `check_call` clones `callee_modes`, `sig.params`, and builds `modes`/`arg_tirs` per call (3-4 allocations); (c) method dispatch does `pool.str(..).to_string()` per method call site, allocated even before the receiver-type check.
**Resolution:** (a) `HashMap<InstRef, TirRef>` or per-function UIR slice (the expr memo is the only consumer that needs random access); (b) borrow from the signatures table instead of cloning; (c) match on pre-interned `StringId`s for `len`/`is_empty` instead of a `String`.

### I-093 — Runtime functions are re-imported per use site; JIT symbol list is hand-synced

**Files:** `ryo-backend/src/codegen/expr.rs` (`declare_runtime_fn` :507-525 and call sites), `ryo-backend/src/codegen/mod.rs` (JIT symbol table; dead `ryo_str_alloc` registration :354)
**Summary:** No name→`FuncId` cache exists; two `int_to_str` calls in one function produce two import declarations. Same for libc `write` and `exit`. Additionally `ryo_str_alloc` is registered in the JIT symbol table (`codegen/mod.rs:354`) with no call site anywhere — the symbol list and the call sites are kept in sync by hand.
**Resolution:** Add a per-module `HashMap<&'static str, FuncId>` cache on `Codegen`; drive the JIT symbol list from the same table.

### I-094 — `compile_function` renders CLIF text unconditionally

**Files:** `ryo-backend/src/codegen/mod.rs` (:800, discarded at :445)
**Summary:** `compile_function` always `format!`s the Cranelift function even on the plain `compile` path where the caller discards it — one full CLIF pretty-print per function per compile, thrown away.
**Resolution:** Only render when an IR dump was requested (thread a flag, or render separately in `compile_and_dump_ir`).

### I-095 — `emit_scoped_body` clones the locals maps per block

**Files:** `ryo-backend/src/codegen/mod.rs` (:845-847)
**Summary:** Each if-arm/loop body clones the `locals`, `str_locals`, and `view_locals` HashMaps to get restore-on-exit semantics — O(locals) per block, quadratic-ish on deep nesting. (Entry predates `view_locals`; all three maps are cloned today.)
**Resolution:** Track per-block bindings as a small undo log (name → previous `Variable`) and restore on exit instead of cloning whole maps.

### I-096 — `~/.ryo/cache` grows unbounded

**Files:** `ryo-backend/src/runtime_lib.rs` (:17-40)
**Summary:** Runtime archives are cached by content hash and never evicted (42 archives / 556 MB observed on a dev machine). `extract_runtime_to_temp` is a misnomer (persistent cache, not temp) and `cleanup_runtime_temp` is a no-op; stale `.tmp.{pid}` files linger after a kill.
**Resolution:** Keep-last-N eviction by mtime (or a `ryo toolchain clean` command); rename the functions to reflect cache semantics; sweep stale `.tmp.*` on extract.

### I-097 — Embedded runtime archive is ~6 MB

**Files:** `ryo-backend/src/runtime_lib.rs` (:5), `runtime/` (build profile)
**Summary:** `include_bytes!` bakes the full staticlib into the compiler binary. The archive has been `no_std` since the runtime migration (std, and the `_Unwind_*` link wart with it, is gone), but it still bundles all of core's precompiled objects, which is what keeps it large. Measured 2026-08-24 (aarch64-apple-darwin): 6.06 MB debug / 5.81 MB release.
**Resolution:** Build the embedded archive with a slim profile (`opt-level="z"`, strip, LTO — the build scripts control that invocation). The `no_std` migration already landed and did not shrink the archive on its own.

### I-099 — `run_file` debug output is load-bearing for the integration suite

**Files:** `ryo-driver/src/pipeline.rs` (`run_file` :558-566), `ryo/tests/` (six integration binaries)
**Summary:** `ryo run` echoes `[Input Source]`, the full AST, and `[Codegen]` on every invocation; 54 `[Result]` and 29 `[Codegen]` assertions across the six integration binaries key on the section markers as the pass/fail signal, and tests post-filter stdout (split on `"[Codegen]"`). Any cleanup of the chatter breaks the suite.
**Resolution:** Gate the debug sections behind a `--verbose` flag, then migrate tests to exit-code assertions. The harness migration to `env!("CARGO_BIN_EXE_ryo")` (no `cargo run` subprocess per test) has already landed — `run_file` itself is the remaining work.

### I-100 — CodSpeed AOT lanes are unverified and masked by `allow-empty`; no backend benchmarks

**Files:** `.github/workflows/codspeed.yml` (:53-111), `codspeed.yml` (repo root), `ryo-frontend/benches/frontend.rs`
**Summary:** Correction of the earlier text: the AOT lanes DO have registered benchmarks — `codspeed.yml` (root, since e7efcc4) maps `fibonacci-aot` and `eager-destruction-aot` to the compiled binaries, and `codspeed run` executes `codspeed.yml` entries per the [CodSpeed CLI docs](https://codspeed.io/docs/cli). The walltime lane (`codspeed-macro`) and the memory lane (`ubuntu-latest`, eBPF-capable) should both report data, and the memory lane is the closest thing to automated validation of the "2× less heap" claim that exists. Real gaps: (1) both lanes set `allow-empty: true`, so any future drift (renamed binary, broken config, deleted `codspeed.yml`) silently degrades them to measuring nothing again — the same silent-skip failure mode the valgrind smoke suite had; (2) ~~no Cranelift-codegen/linking instrumented benchmarks~~ — addressed: `ryo-backend/benches/backend.rs` (simulation-mode codegen benches over the JIT module, run by the `backend-benchmarks` job); linking remains unmeasured; (3) the 2× ratio itself is computed by hand from `benchmarks/eager_destruction/run_benchmarks.sh`, not asserted anywhere.
**Resolution:** Root cause of the historical empty output found (2026-07): the jobs passed `run: codspeed run`, nesting the CLI inside the action's runner — CodSpeed's docs state config-file benchmarks must OMIT `run:` so the action reads `codspeed.yml` directly. Fixed by dropping `run:` from both AOT jobs and removing `allow-empty: true` so any future drift (renamed binary, broken config, deleted `codspeed.yml`) fails CI loudly. Remaining: verify in the CodSpeed dashboard that both lanes report data for both registered benchmarks; optionally add a CI step asserting eager_destruction's peak RSS stays under a fixed bound (the manual script's check, automated).

### I-102 — Smoke suites duplicate work across lanes and fixture builds

**Files:** `ryo/tests/asan_smoke.rs`, `ryo/tests/valgrind_smoke.rs`, `ryo/tests/common/mod.rs`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (:83)
**Summary:** Both suites iterate the same 11 fixtures (`common/mod.rs:81-210`), compiling+linking each twice per full run; each `build_and_link` also shells out to `ryo toolchain status --path` to find zig (:10-22). `cargo test --workspace` in the test lane already includes `asan_smoke`, so it runs twice on ubuntu (test lane + dedicated asan lane); valgrind "runs" (silently skips when the binary is absent) in lanes without valgrind.
**Resolution:** Share fixture compilation across suites, cache the zig path, and exclude the smoke suites from the default test lane (or from the dedicated lanes).

### I-104 — `ryo-core` depends on chumsky solely for `SimpleSpan`

**Files:** `ryo-core/src/diag.rs` (:18-20), `ryo-core/Cargo.toml`
**Summary:** The "core" IR/types crate pulls in a parser crate for one span type, coupling every consumer of `ryo-core` to chumsky's release cycle.
**Resolution:** Define a small `Span` newtype in `ryo-core` and convert at the parser boundary (`pipeline.rs` already adapts spans).

### I-109 — No instruction→function reverse mapping in UIR

**Files:** `ryo-core/src/uir.rs` (`func_bodies` :272, :279-284)
**Summary:** `func_bodies` lists only top-level statement refs; given an arbitrary `InstRef` you cannot tell which function owns it without walking every body. Any pass wanting per-function slices of the shared arena (diagnostics, per-function codegen, future incremental sema) re-derives this by traversal.
**Resolution:** Add a computed inst→body index map (built lazily or at `finish()`), or move to per-function UIR arenas mirroring TIR when Phase 5 lands.

### I-111 — Lexer token boilerplate is four touch points per variant

**Files:** `ryo-frontend/src/lexer.rs` (`RawToken` :176-300, `Token` :30-103, `intern_token` :392-495, `Display` :105-170)
**Summary:** Adding a token means editing `RawToken`, `Token`, the giant manual `intern_token` match, and `Display` (plus the parser downstream) — ~45 non-payload variants of pure boilerplate.
**Resolution:** Generate the quadruple from a single macro table (variant name, logos pattern, payload kind).

### I-128 — Pass entry points far exceed the R7 size discipline

**Files:** measured by brace-depth scan, tests excluded — worst offenders (refs refreshed 2026-08-24, post-split): `ryo-frontend/src/ownership/walk.rs` `visit_expr` :782 (~424 raw / 298 code lines), `analyze_if_stmt` :507 (210 code); `ryo-frontend/src/ownership/mod.rs` `analyze_function` :286; `ryo-frontend/src/sema/stmt.rs` `analyze_stmt` :14 (360 code lines — at the ratchet); `ryo-frontend/src/sema/expr.rs` `analyze_expr_allow_never` :37 (~322 raw), `check_binary_op` :439 (~265); `ryo-frontend/src/sema/builtins.rs` `emit_builtin_call` :10 (~225); `ryo-frontend/src/sema/call.rs` `check_call` :12 (~220); `ryo-backend/src/codegen/expr.rs` `eval_inst` :18, `eval_inst_str` :829, `emit_call`; `ryo-backend/src/codegen/mod.rs` `emit_stmt` :909, `compile_function` :549; `ryo-frontend/src/parser.rs` `expression_parser`; `ryo-core/src/uir.rs` `write_inst` :1106 and the same pattern in `ryo-core/src/tir.rs`
**Summary:** R7 targets functions under 50 lines so a human reviewer can hold each one in their head. Sixteen functions sit between ~150 and ~410 lines, almost all of them giant per-tag dispatch `match`es in the hottest passes. These are the files every milestone touches; review cost and merge-conflict surface scale with their length. (Distinct from I-094, which tracks a *content* problem inside one of these functions, not size.)
**Resolution:** Split the entry points into one helper per tag/arm family (`lower_match_expr`-style naming per R7), keeping the dispatch match as a thin table. Do it opportunistically when a function is next touched for a feature — starting with `visit_expr` and `analyze_stmt`, the two worst — rather than as one big-bang refactor. `clippy::too_many_lines` is denied workspace-wide with `too-many-lines-threshold = 360` as a ratchet; lower the threshold towards 50 as functions split.

### I-135 — Rule-7 call-arg partition duplicates the view look-through logic

**Files:** `ryo-frontend/src/ownership/walk.rs` (:934-936 — owner partition, :1029-1030 — E0031 span search)
**Summary:** The `mode == Borrow && tag == ViewAsOwner → projection_root else underlying_owner` look-through is written out twice, near-verbatim, in two helpers that must agree for the P6'/E4 rules to stay coherent. A change to one side (e.g. a new look-through case) silently desynchronizes the diagnostic span search from the ownership partition.
**Resolution:** Extract one `fn call_arg_owner(own, tir, pool, mode, arg) -> Owner` helper used by both sites.

### I-136 — Ownership pass clones whole state maps on hot paths

**Files:** `ryo-frontend/src/ownership/walk.rs` (:556-578 — `Ownership` clone per if/elif/else arm), `ryo-frontend/src/ownership/loops.rs` (:480-537 — map clones + `sidecar.clone()` per propagate pass)
**Summary:** Every branch arm and every loop-propagate pass deep-clones the full ownership state (19 fields, several `HashMap`s). Correct, but against R3's allocation discipline on the hottest analysis path; the cost grows with function body size. (Codegen's per-block map clones are tracked separately as I-095.)
**Resolution:** After I-129 converts the dense-index maps to `Vec` side tables, replace whole-state clones with snapshot/restore of the four non-monotone fields only, or a copy-on-write per-arm overlay. Measure on the benchmark suite before and after.

### I-164 — Guard-elision extensions deferred from the value-range work

**Files:** `ryo-backend/src/codegen/expr.rs` (checked-op helpers, `emit_div_guard`), `ryo-backend/src/codegen/mod.rs` (if/while emission)
**Summary:** The value-range fact map behind the landed overflow-guard elision (I-142, commit `d6aee06`) deliberately scopes to guards on `+`/`-`/`*`/unary `-` seeded from bare `var <cmp> const` conditions. Four cheap extensions were identified during that work and deferred, each independent and small once the fact map exists: (a) div/mod zero-guard elision — when the divisor's range excludes 0, the `emit_div_guard` branch is provably unreachable; (b) `BoolAnd`/`BoolOr` decomposition — `x > 0 && y > 0` can seed both sides on the true path (De Morgan on the false path); (c) `VarDecl` constant seeding — `x = 5` records a point fact, useful once real programs (not just fib) are the yardstick; (d) loop-exit facts — a `while` condition's false path holds at the exit block, but only for condition variables never reassigned in the body.
**Resolution:** Revisit when benchmark headroom justifies it — note that the fibonacci checkpoint (2026-08-26, `benchmarks/fibonacci/README.md`) showed the landed elision produced no walltime change on out-of-order hardware, so these extensions are expected to be equally cheap-but-invisible there; their value is on in-order/constrained targets. Each item follows the same discipline as the landed elision work: boundary-value pinning tests per elision class, since a wrong elision silently drops a mandated trap.

### I-165 — Surviving overflow guards lower to unfused `cset`+`tst`+`b.ne` instead of a single flag branch

**Files:** `ryo-backend/src/codegen/expr.rs` (checked-op helpers, panic-block branch emission)
**Summary:** Ryo's spec §18 checked arithmetic emits an overflow guard per integer `+`/`-`/`*`. After the value-range work (I-142) removed the provably-unreachable guards from the fibonacci hot path, the one remaining guard (the outer `fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)` add) lowers on aarch64 to `adds` + `cset x13, vs` + `tst w13, #0xff` + `b.ne` — three instructions where Swift emits the fused `adds` + `b.hs` (one). Disassembly of `benchmarks/fibonacci/fib` (2026-08-27) shows the overflow flag from `sadd_overflow` is materialized into an SSA boolean and only branched on later, which prevents Cranelift's flag-fusion lowering. x86-64 has the same shape (`seto` + `test` + `jne` instead of a single `jo`). Cranelift 0.134/0.135's branch-to-trap folding does not apply because Ryo's guards branch to a `ryo_panic` call block rather than a raw trap — and even if it did, the flag not feeding the branch directly would block fusion.
**Resolution:** Emit the branch on the overflow-flag value immediately at the checked-op site (no intermediate SSA bool / block separation), so Cranelift's branch-on-flags lowering can fuse it into `b.vs`/`jo`; verify by disassembly diff of the fibonacci hot path before/after. Do not switch to `trapz`/`trapnz` — that bypasses the `ryo_panic` message/exit-code contract (previously considered and rejected when the panic guards were introduced).

### I-144 — Per-if clone and repeated dead-drop scans in codegen

**Files:** `ryo-backend/src/codegen/mod.rs` (`if_branches.get(...).cloned().unwrap_or_default()` :1196; called per arm :1237/:1273/:1289/:1305), `ryo-backend/src/codegen/expr.rs` (`emit_conditional_dead_drops` :703-719)
**Summary:** Every if-statement clones the `IfBranchIds` payload (heap `Vec` for elif branches) out of the sidecar even when there is no entry, because `.cloned().unwrap_or_default()` goes through `ctx`. Separately, `emit_conditional_dead_drops` re-scans the whole per-function `conditional_dead_drops` Vec at the start of *every* if arm with no empty-check early exit, and re-imports `ryo_str_free` inside the drop loop (`expr.rs:713`, cross-ref I-093). On if-heavy functions with dead drops this is O(ifs × arms × drops).
**Resolution:** Borrow the sidecar out of `ctx` first so `get` returns a reference instead of cloning; add the same `is_empty()` early-return `emit_due_frees` already has or index dead drops by `if_stmt` in a map built once per function; hoist the `ryo_str_free` import out of the loop.

### I-145 — Ownership materializes the full states map per break/continue

**Files:** `ryo-frontend/src/ownership/loops.rs` (`schedule_break_continue_frees` :753, per-jump snapshot :546)
**Summary:** Every break/continue jump clones the entire `own.states` map into a sorted `Vec`, then builds `on_path`/`covers_this_jump`/`free_inside_loop` sets and scans the whole `free_schedule` — all per jump, though the snapshot is constant within a loop body walk. The per-loop invariants are precomputed once per loop (`LoopExitCtx`); this per-jump residue remains.
**Resolution:** Hoist the sorted snapshot to once per loop body walk (or iterate the map with an index); reuse scratch sets across jumps.

### I-146 — `collect_view_liveness` clones the bindings map per if/arm/loop

**Files:** `ryo-frontend/src/ownership/views.rs` (`collect_view_liveness` :254; `bindings` clones :344, :430)
**Summary:** The view-liveness pre-walk clones the full `bindings` map per if statement (`pre = bindings.clone()`) and again per arm, plus per-arm fresh read maps, and clones per loop body. Same class as I-136's merge-path clones but a different pass, so I-136's resolution won't sweep it up unless extended.
**Resolution:** Apply the same snapshot/undo-log or overlay approach chosen for I-136; fix both passes together.

### I-147 — `emit_builtin_call` allocates mode Vecs per builtin call

**Files:** `ryo-frontend/src/sema/builtins.rs` (:22)
**Summary:** Every `print`/`panic`/`assert`/conversion call site builds `vec![ParamMode::Borrow; arg_tirs.len()]` and clones it — two allocations per builtin call though builtin arities and modes are statically known. Adjacent to I-092(b), which covers `check_call` but not the builtin path.
**Resolution:** Static per-builtin mode tables; only `str_push` needs a non-uniform one.

### I-148 — Per-argument callee-name string lookups in the ownership pass

**Files:** `ryo-frontend/src/ownership/walk.rs` (`is_borrowed_scalar_param` call :847, `view_borrow_params` call :917), `ryo-frontend/src/builtins.rs` (:128-148)
**Summary:** `is_borrowed_scalar_param` runs `pool.str(name_id)` plus two linear `&'static str` table scans *per argument of every call*, though the result depends only on the callee; `view_borrow_params` repeats it per borrow-mode Call arg. Same string-compare class as I-034, but the per-arg (not per-call) repetition is a new facet.
**Resolution:** Hoist the lookup out of the arg loop (once per Call inst); the longer-term fix is I-034's cached-`StringId` table.

### I-149 — Lexer allocates a `String` per escape-free string literal

**Files:** `ryo-frontend/src/lexer.rs` (`unescape` :425-491, called at :542)
**Summary:** Every string literal gets an owned `String` from `unescape` even when it contains no escapes — the common case. Per string literal.
**Resolution:** Fast-path with `memchr(b'\\')` (or a byte scan) returning `Cow::Borrowed(inner)` when no escape is present; build the owned string only on the escape path.

### I-150 — Each function's Cranelift `Signature` is built twice

**Files:** `ryo-backend/src/codegen/mod.rs` (`build_signature` called at :490 and :590)
**Summary:** `declare_all_functions` builds every function's `Signature` to register the `FuncId`, then `compile_function` rebuilds the identical signature — redundant pool queries and two Vec allocations per function.
**Resolution:** Store the `Signature` alongside the `FuncId` in `func_ids` and move/clone it into `ctx.func`.

### I-152 — Parser builds a throwaway `Vec` per call/params node before the arena copy

**Files:** `ryo-frontend/src/parser.rs` (:604-615, :650-661, :534-538, :436-446)
**Summary:** Call args, method args, params, and elif branches are `collect::<Vec<_>>()`ed into a temporary, copied into the AST side arena by the builder, then dropped — a double buffer per node. Partly inherent to chumsky's `IterParser`; impact is small next to the win the arena already delivered.
**Resolution:** A custom collector writing straight into the arena (chumsky 0.12 collects via `FromIterator`, so an arena-append adapter is feasible), or accept as-is. Measure before bothering.

### I-153 — `expect_used` audit before promoting to deny

**Files:** the `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -W clippy::expect_used` hit list (`ryo-frontend/src/ownership/`, `ryo-core/src/ast.rs`, `ryo-core/src/types.rs`, `ryo-core/src/uir.rs`, `ryo-core/src/tir.rs` are the dense ones)
**Summary:** `expect_used` is the one panic-family lint still at `allow` in `[workspace.lints.clippy]` (`panic`/`todo`/`unimplemented`/`unwrap_used` are denied). 70 sites fire at last count, 56 of them outside `ryo/tests/`; many are deliberate arena-boundary guards (`from_index`, side-arena overflow checks) — legitimate invariant enforcement, not laziness.
**Resolution:** Classify each site as keep-with-message (genuine internal invariant) vs convert-to-diagnostic (reachable from user input), then consider promoting `expect_used` to `deny`.

### I-157 — Linux AOT links host glibc by accident; evaluate static musl

**Files:** `ryo-backend/src/linker.rs` (:13-15, no `-target` passed to `zig cc`), `build-support/src/lib.rs` (:41, runtime archive built for the compiler's `TARGET`)
**Summary:** On Linux, `ryo build` links natively via `zig cc` with no `-target`, so binaries are dynamically coupled to whatever glibc the build host has — a silent portability gap, not a decision. The runtime staticlib is already `no_std`, so produced binaries need almost nothing from libc, which makes fully static musl (`-target <arch>-linux-musl`) nearly free and matches where Go (no libc), Rust (musl tier-1 opt-in), and Swift (Static Linux SDK) all converged. macOS (libSystem, dynamic mandatory) and Windows (MSVC ABI + UCRT via zig) need no equivalent change.
**Resolution:** Before applying, re-verify the drawbacks: (1) musl mallocng is slow under multithreaded allocation-heavy load — matters once Go-style concurrency and `shared[T]` refcount churn land; may force shipping our own allocator in `ryo-runtime` first; (2) no NSS, limited `getaddrinfo`, no dlopen of glibc-built libs. If accepted: pass `-target <arch>-linux-musl` in `linker.rs` and switch the `build-support` archive build to the matching `*-unknown-linux-musl` triple in the same change (the two must move together), then check what the ASan/Valgrind smoke lanes still exercise under a static link.

### I-161 — Tiny runtime string ops cross the extern-call boundary per use

**Files:** `ryo-backend/src/codegen/expr.rs` (`ryo_str_eq` call :282, `__ryo_slice` call :1022, `ryo_str_from_literal` call :1132), `runtime/src/lib.rs` (bodies: `ryo_str_from_literal` :251, `__ryo_slice` :319, `ryo_str_eq` :448)
**Summary:** Codegen imports these as opaque extern calls, so every use pays a full call that Cranelift can neither inline nor hoist. The bodies are a handful of instructions: `ryo_str_from_literal` is just `pack_pair` (shift + or), `__ryo_slice` is two bounds checks, two UTF-8 boundary tests, and a `ptr.add`, and `ryo_str_eq` against a short literal is a few byte compares. In `benchmarks/string_slicing` the scan loop makes three such calls per iteration (slice + literal materialization + eq) where Rust inlines all of it to pointer arithmetic and a 3-byte memcmp — the bulk of the measured 3.5× AOT gap (CLIF verified 2026-08-26: the `str`/`strview` param variants are instruction-identical in the loop except for these calls, and a same-compiler A/B ties at 5.9 ms both ways).
**Resolution:** Emit the tiny bodies as inline Cranelift IR at the call sites instead of extern calls (slice keeps its panic paths; eq can specialize when one side is a known short literal). Literal re-materialization is already handled (each distinct literal is emitted once per function in the entry block); inlining `pack_pair` would remove the remaining extern call from that one materialization. Larger ops (`ryo_str_concat`, `__ryo_str_push`) stay extern.

### I-166 — Sema does not reject constant `INT_MIN / -1` at compile time

**Files:** `ryo-frontend/src/sema.rs` (the literal-zero division check), `ryo-backend/src/codegen/expr.rs` (`emit_div_guard`)
**Summary:** The codegen division guard panics at runtime on `x / 0` and `x % 0`, with `INT_MIN / -1` and `INT_MIN % -1` covered by the signed-overflow guard fix; but sema only rejects the literal-zero-divisor form at compile time. The constant case `INT_MIN / -1` (dividend a known `i64::MIN` constant, divisor the literal expression `-1` — a unary minus, not a literal) still compiles and only fails when executed. Deferred from the runtime-guard fix as likely not worth it: the shape is rare and the runtime guard covers correctness.
**Resolution:** In sema's division checks, when the divisor expression is a unary-minus of literal `1` and the dividend's constant value (or range) is exactly `i64::MIN`, emit a compile-time diagnostic pointing at the division. Skip if constant/range info is not already in scope at that site — do not plumb new machinery for this edge case.

### I-167 — Systematic audit of the runtime FFI boundary beyond the known gaps

**Files:** `runtime/src/lib.rs` (all `#[unsafe(no_mangle)]` entry points)
**Summary:** Two robustness gaps at the C-ABI boundary were fixed directly (conflated abort modes for OOM vs capacity overflow, and debug-only null checks on `ryo_print` / `ryo_panic` / the slice path), but they were found by inspection, not by a systematic pass. Other entry points may have similar under-checked inputs: untrusted `len`/`cap` values that flow into `write_all`/`memcpy`/allocation size arithmetic, raw pointers beyond the three known sites, and panic/abort paths whose exit codes or messages are load-bearing for codegen assumptions.
**Resolution:** One audit pass over every `#[unsafe(no_mangle)]` function in `runtime/src/lib.rs`: for each, enumerate the caller contract (which args are trusted vs attacker/bad-codegen-controlled), confirm each unsafe dereference is guarded or documented, and confirm each abort path reports a distinct, accurate message. Fix what's found in the same pass; it's a small file.

### I-168 — Hyphenated `ryo-*.md` doc names violate the lowercase-underscore convention

**Files:** `docs/dev/` (`ryo-incremental-compilation.md`, `ryo-context-and-otel-proposal.md`, `ryo-std-data-proposal.md`, `ryo-proposal-review-issues.md`, `ryo-missing-features-and-gaps.md`, `ryo-view-materialization.md`, `ryo-slicing-and-memory-model-final-spec.md`, `ryo-compiler-llm-instructions.md`), plus every doc that links to them
**Summary:** The repo convention is lowercase with underscores for docs (special files like `README.md` excepted). The eight `ryo-*-*.md` files under `docs/dev/` use hyphens instead. `NOTES.md` was renamed to `notes.md` as the cheap half of this cleanup; the hyphenated set was scoped out because each rename must also update every inbound link (`CLAUDE.md`, `ISSUES.md`, the roadmap, and the docs/dev README index at minimum).
**Resolution:** One sweep: `git mv` each `ryo-*.md` to its underscore form, then repo-wide grep for each old basename to update links. Verify no residual references with a final grep for `ryo-.*\.md` across tracked markdown.
