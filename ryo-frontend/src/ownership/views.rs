/// * Override: a view read in this arm whose global last use lies in
///   a DIFFERENT arm of this if dies at its arm-local last read. The
///   replaced entries are returned for `restore_view_last_use` (the
///   walk-constant map must be whole again before the next arm and

/// * Kill: a view whose every remaining read lies in OTHER arms of
///   this if (global last use inside the if's subtree, none in this
///   arm's) is already dead on this arm's path — its projection is
///   removed for the duration of the arm walk. `analyze_if_stmt`'s
///   per-arm snapshot/restore of `live_projections` scopes the
///   removal to this arm.
///
/// Both cases skip loop-deferred views (`view_defer_loop`): a later
/// iteration re-reads them through the back-edge, so they are live on
/// every arm's path regardless of this arm's reads. The deferral table
/// is computed from the GLOBAL max read only, so the override applies
/// the same deferral test per candidate: an arm-local last read inside
/// a loop the creation is outside of (`created_in < read_in`, the
/// pre-pass's condition) blocks the override — installing it would let
/// the death site drain the projection mid-loop and un-freeze a later
/// owner mutation in the same body. (Skipped, the view stays live to
/// the join: conservative.) The kill needs no such per-candidate test:
/// it fires only when the arm has NO reads in its subtree, so there is
/// no deeper arm-local read to strand; a deeper read in a SIBLING arm
/// is itself a global-max read the pre-pass deferral already covers.
/// Neither case applies when the global last use is OUTSIDE the if's
/// subtree — a post-join read lies on every path and keeps the view
