//! Ownership pass — validates move safety on per-`TirRef` lattice.
//!
//! Runs between sema and codegen. Walks each `Tir` forward, tracking
//! ownership state for every Move-typed value. Catches use-after-move,
//! moves out of borrowed parameters, and returns of borrowed values.
//! M8.4 adds slice-projection tracking (final spec §3.2/§3.3): bound
//! `strview` views register against their root owner (P3), an owner with
//! a live projection is frozen against moves and mutation (P2),
//! projections end at their last use (P4), destruction defers to the
//! last projection use (P5), and views cannot escape (E1/E2). Emits
//! diagnostics into the shared `DiagSink` — does not mutate TIR and
//! does not insert Free instructions (that lands in M8.1c).
//!
//! ## State lattice
//!
//! Per-TirRef state, not per-binding. A binding name resolves through
//! a shadow `current_owner: HashMap<StringId, TirRef>` to whichever
//! SSA value currently owns the underlying allocation. Anonymous owned
//! temporaries (concat results, formatter outputs) live in the same
//! `states` map with no shadow entry.
//!
//! See `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-20-milestone-8.1-heap-str-and-move-semantics-design.md`
