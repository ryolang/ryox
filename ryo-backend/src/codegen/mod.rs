//! Cranelift codegen over TIR.
//!
//! Codegen consumes the typed instruction streams produced by
//! `sema` (one [`Tir`] per function body) and lowers them to
//! Cranelift IR. There is no [`crate::uir::Uir`] import here:
//! every operand is already typed, every variable already
//! resolved.
//!
//! Traversal is *index-driven* — operands are reached through
//! [`TirRef`] indices into the current `Tir`'s `instructions`,
//! never through a recursive descent over a tree-shaped node.
//! Two recursions survive:
//!
//! 1. Materializing an instruction whose operands are themselves
//!    instructions (e.g. `IAdd %3, %5` materializes `%3` and `%5`
//!    first). Cranelift always needs nested values; doing it
//!    through `TirRef` indexing is the point.
//! 2. The `eval_inst` memoization table (dense `Vec<Option<ValueRepr>>`
//!    indexed by `TirRef::index()`)
//!    so a shared sub-expression isn't re-emitted. TIR today is
//!    tree-shaped (one parent per inst) so this is purely
//!    defensive — but it's the right invariant before lazy sema
//!    / inline expansion lands. Zig calls the analogous mapping
//!    in `Air.zig` "liveness"; we don't need full liveness yet.
