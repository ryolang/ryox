**Ryo /ˈraɪoʊ/: Productive, Safe, Fast.**

Ryo is a new, statically-typed, compiled programming language designed for developers who love the **simplicity of Python** but need the **performance and memory safety** guarantees of languages like Rust or Go, without the steep learning curve.

Build reliable and efficient **web backends, CLI tools, and scripts** with an approachable syntax, powerful compile-time checks, and a familiar async/await concurrency model. Ryo manages memory safely via ownership and borrowing (simplified, no manual lifetimes) **without a garbage collector**, ensuring predictable performance and eliminating entire classes of bugs.

**This project contains the source code for the Ryo compiler, standard library, and tooling.**


> [!WARNING]
> Ryo is currently in the **early stages of development** (pre-alpha). The language design is stabilizing, but the compiler is under active construction. It is **not yet ready for production use**. We welcome contributors!

## Current Implementation Status (Milestone 3)

**✅ What's Working Now:**

The Ryo compiler currently implements **Milestone 3: AOT Compilation** with the following capabilities:

- **Lexer & Parser**: Full tokenization and parsing of variable declarations and expressions
- **Code Generation**: Compiles to native object files using Cranelift backend
- **Linking**: Multi-linker fallback (`zig cc` → `clang` → `cc`) for cross-platform support
- **Arithmetic Operations**: Integer literals, binary operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`), unary negation
- **Expressions**: Parenthesized expressions with correct operator precedence
- **Variable Declarations**: With optional type annotations and `mut` keyword
- **Exit Codes**: All programs exit with 0 (success) - explicit returns coming in Milestone 4
- **Cross-Platform**: Generates native executables for x86_64, aarch64 (Apple Silicon), and more

**Working Example (Compiles Today):**

```ryo
# arithmetic.ryo - A working Milestone 3 program

x = 2 + 3 * 4      # Computes 14 (operator precedence: multiply first)
                    # Program exits with 0 (success)
```

```bash
# Compile and run
cargo run -- run arithmetic.ryo
# Output: [Result] => 0
```

**Test Coverage:** 79 passing tests (32 lexer + 32 parser + 15 codegen integration tests)

**❌ What's Coming Next:**

The features described below are **design goals** under active development:

- **Milestone 4**: Functions (beyond `main`), local variables with storage
- **Milestone 5**: More operators and expressions
- **Milestone 6**: Control flow (`if`/`else`, booleans)
- **Milestone 7**: Error handling (`error`, `try`, `catch`)
- **Milestone 8+**: Strings, ownership system, structs, traits, async/await, and more

**See the full roadmap:** [Implementation Roadmap](docs/implementation_roadmap.md)

## Why Ryo?

*   **🐍 Simple & Productive:** Write clear, readable code with a clean syntax inspired by Python (tabs, f-strings, tuples, built-in `print`). Reduce boilerplate and focus on your logic.
*   **🛡️ Safe & Reliable:** Compile-time memory safety via "Ownership Lite" prevents dangling pointers, data races, and use-after-free errors without a GC. Explicit error handling with `error` types, `try`, and `catch` makes code robust. No null thanks to optional types (`?T` and `none`).
*   **🚀 Fast & Efficient:** Compiled to native code using **Cranelift** for excellent performance. No garbage collection pauses mean predictable speed. Familiar async/await concurrency for scalable applications with excellent Python developer ergonomics.
*   **🧩 Modern Tooling:** Integrated package manager (`ryo`), fast compiler, interactive REPL (JIT), built-in testing framework.
*   **✨ Compile-Time Power (`comptime`):** Run code at compile time for metaprogramming, configuration loading, and pre-computation without runtime cost or complex macros.
*   **🧩 Pragmatic Interoperability:** Designed with C FFI for leveraging existing native code. (Future goals include exploring closer integration with ecosystems like Python).

## Features Overview

*   **Memory Management:** Ownership & Borrowing (Simplified, "Ownership Lite"), No GC, RAII (`Drop`), Immutable-by-Default variables for safer code.
*   **Concurrency:** Python-familiar async/await with high-performance async runtime
*   **Syntax:** Python-inspired, tab-indented, expressions, statements
*   **Types:** Static typing with bidirectional type inference (like Rust/TypeScript), primitives (`int`, `float`, `bool`, `str`, `char`), tuples, `struct`, `enum` (ADTs), `trait` (static dispatch initially). Function signatures require types, local variables inferred. Variables are immutable by default (no `let` keyword), use `mut` for mutability
*   **Error Handling:** Type-safe, explicit error handling system:
    - **Single-variant errors only**: `error Timeout`, `error NotFound(str)`, `error HttpError(status: int, message: str)` - unified syntax for all error definitions
    - **Module-based error grouping**: Organize related errors in modules: `module math: error DivisionByZero`
    - **Error unions** with automatic composition: `fn process() -> !Data` infers `(FileError | ParseError)!Data` from `try` expressions
    - **Error trait** with automatic message generation: All errors implement `.message() -> str`
    - **Try/catch operators** for ergonomic error propagation and handling
    - **Optional types** (`?T` and `none`) for nullable values - no null pointer exceptions
    - **Exhaustive pattern matching by default**: All error unions require handling all error types exhaustively (or explicit `_` catch-all)
*   **Compile-Time Execution:** `comptime` blocks and functions
*   **Tooling:** `ryo` command (compiler, runner, REPL, package manager frontend), `ryopkg` logic integrated, Cranelift backend (AOT/JIT/Wasm)
*   **FFI:** C interoperability via `extern "C"` and `unsafe` blocks, `ffi` stdlib module. (Future Goal: Explore deeper integration with other language ecosystems like Python).
*   **Standard Library:** Modular packages (`io`, `str`, `collections`, `http`, `json`, `os`, etc.)
*   **Future Concurrency Extensions:** CSP-style channels (`chan`, `select`) planned as optional additions for specialized use cases like actor systems and data pipelines

For full details, see the [Language Specification](docs/specification.md) (Link to spec file).

## Language Inspirations

Ryo draws inspiration from the best features of modern programming languages:

*   **🐍 Python** - Clean syntax with colons and indentation, f-strings, type inference, async/await
*   **🦀 Rust** - Ownership model for memory safety, algebraic data types (enums), pattern matching, trait system
*   **🔥 Mojo** - Simplified ownership without lifetimes, value semantics, progressive complexity
*   **🔷 Go** - Simplicity as a core value, fast compilation, pragmatic concurrency (CSP channels planned)
*   **⚡ Zig** - Comptime execution for zero-cost abstractions, explicit error handling, no hidden control flow

**The Result:** A language that's **easier than Rust** (no lifetimes), **safer than Python** (compile-time memory safety), **more expressive than Go** (generics, ADTs), and **more familiar than Zig** (Python-like syntax).

## Quick Example

### Design Vision (Future)

> **Note:** This example shows Ryo's planned features. Most are not yet implemented.

```ryo
# src/main.ryo - Design example showing future features

fn greet(name: &str) -> str:
    return f"Hello, {name}! Welcome to Ryo."

fn main():
    # Variables are immutable by default (no 'let' keyword)
    message = greet("World")  # Type inferred: str
    print(message)

    # Mutable variables use 'mut'
    mut counter = 0  # Type inferred: int
    counter += 1

    # Safe collections
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    print(f"Numbers: {numbers}")

    # Memory safe - optional types prevent null pointer exceptions!
    user: ?str = "Alice"

    # Safe optional chaining
    message = user?.len() orelse 0
    print(f"User message length: {message}")

    # Safe error handling
    print(process_user(user))

module process:
    error InvalidUser

fn process_user(user: ?str) -> process.InvalidUser!str:
    name = user orelse return process.InvalidUser
    return f"Processing user: {name}"
```

### Working Today (Milestone 3)

```ryo
# arithmetic.ryo - Compiles and runs now!

# Variable declarations with type annotations
x: int = 42
y: int = 10

# Arithmetic expressions with correct precedence
result = x + y * 2    # 42 + (10 * 2) = 62

# Multiple statements - all evaluated, program exits with 0
final = result - 20   # 62 - 20 = 42 (computed, but exit code is 0)
```

```bash
# Compile and run
cargo run -- run arithmetic.ryo
# Output: [Result] => 0

# Or see the compilation stages
cargo run -- lex arithmetic.ryo    # View tokens
cargo run -- parse arithmetic.ryo  # View AST
cargo run -- ir arithmetic.ryo     # View IR info
```

**More working examples:** See `examples/milestone3/` directory for additional programs you can compile and run today!

## Getting Started & Installation

### Prerequisites

Before building Ryo, you need:

1. **Rust toolchain** (1.91): [Install Rust](https://rustup.rs/)
2. **A C linker** (one of the following):
   - **Zig** (recommended): [Download Zig](https://ziglang.org/download/)
   - **Clang**: Included with Xcode Command Line Tools (macOS) or build-essential (Linux)
   - **GCC/cc**: System default compiler

### Building from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ryolang/ryox.git
cd ryox

# Build the compiler (debug mode for development)
cargo build

# Or build optimized release version
cargo build --release

# Verify the build
cargo run -- --version
```

### Your First Program

Create a simple Ryo program:

```bash
# Create a file called first.ryo
echo "x = 42" > first.ryo

# Compile and run
cargo run -- run first.ryo
```

You should see output like:
```
[Input Source]
x = 42

[AST]
Program (0..6)
└── Statement [VarDecl] (0..6)
    VarDecl
      ├── name: x (0..1)
      └── initializer:
          Literal(Int(42)) (4..6)

[Codegen]
Generated object file: first.o
Linked with zig cc: first
[Result] => 0
```

### Current Workflow (Milestone 3)

Since Milestone 3 focuses on arithmetic expressions, the typical workflow is:

```bash
# Write a simple expression
echo "result = 2 + 3 * 4" > calc.ryo

# Compile and run
cargo run -- run calc.ryo
# Output: [Result] => 0

# Inspect compilation stages
cargo run -- lex calc.ryo     # See tokens
cargo run -- parse calc.ryo   # See AST
cargo run -- ir calc.ryo      # See IR generation info
```

**Note:** Advanced features like project creation (`ryo new`), package management, and REPL are planned for future milestones.
